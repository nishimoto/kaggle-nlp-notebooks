Actually,\nI am  bit puzzled too and a bit relieved. However, I am going to put an end\nto non-PIttsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the Pens. Man, they\nare killing those Devils worse than I thought. Jagr just showed you why\nhe is much better than his regular season stats. He is also a lot\nfo fun to watch in the playoffs. Bowman should let JAgr have a lot of\nfun in the next couple of games since the Pens are going to beat the pulp out of Jersey anyway. I was very disappointed not to see the Islanders lose the final\nregular season game.

It was the religion of the great Persian\\nEmpire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ\\nwas born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three\\nZoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians,\\nJews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the\\nZoroastrian prophet.\\n\\n   Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are \\na miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a\\npeople is very much on their minds.\\n\\n   Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance\\nof the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed\\nby nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause\\ntheir young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.\\n\\n   Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they\\nactually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children\\nbecome totally assimilated, they say, it's their children - rather than\\nthe world at large - who will be the losers.\\n\\n   \\\"It's important to have an identity,\\\" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose,\\na leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  \\\"It's important\\nfor everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life.\\nYou don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect.\\nYou can fall back on your own identity.\\\"\\n\\n   For Zoroastrians, there's much to be proud of.\\n\\n   Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which\\nanimal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was\\nonly one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which\\ntranslates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.\\n\\n_Good vs. evil_\\n\\n   Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with\\nthe good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for\\ngood, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences\\nsuch as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity,\\nkindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of\\nmen and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.\\n\\n   But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to\\nfollow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact,\\nJoseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths,\\ntraced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.\\n\\n   Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a\\nstained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of\\nMount Hamilton, is \\\"Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.\\\"\\n\\n   So it's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India,\\nwhere a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape\\npersecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy;\\nthe overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.\\n\\n   About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India\\nand Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from\\nIran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state\\nwhere others had no rights.\\n\\n   Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on \\\"good\\ndeeds\\\" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose,\\nthe recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because\\nManou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up\\ndowntown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple's\\ndedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the\\nZoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.\\n\\n   The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an\\nIranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples\\nin North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount\\nHamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto,\\nand Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on\\nthis continent.\\n\\n   Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the\\nproperty already had a large house that they have converted to a\\ncommunity center.\\n\\n   The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet \\nZoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted \\nceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.\\n\\n   Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed-\\nin area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are \\nsometimes called \\\"fire worshippers,\\\" they actually consider fire just \\na symbol of God.  \\\"It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the \\ncross and Muslims use the Holy Book,\\\" Bhujwala said.\\n\\n   The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all\\nIranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of\\nthe season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With\\nZoroaster's birthday just six days later, the combination of religious\\nand secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the\\nUnited States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.\\n\\n  For this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday, about 500 people\\ncame to worship and revel.\\n\\n   \\\"The good things in life are not forbidden,\\\" Esfandiar Anoushiravani,\\na leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed\\nproved him right.\\n\\n   Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood\\naround the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted\\nthanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking\\nsandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit\\nand nuts.\\n\\n   Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  \\\"People eat the\\nfruit,\\\" Tarapore said.  \\\"It's a way to participate in the ceremony.\\\"\\n\\n_Santa Claus, sort of_\\n\\n   The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing white\\nhair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore green\\nsymbolic of spring) and red.\\n\\n   He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced and\\nplayed a tambourine.\\n\\n   The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  \\\"This is all new for us, too,\\\"\\none told a visitor who asked what was going on.\\n\\n   A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with\\nthe religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have\\nno procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their\\ncenturies of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu\\nking who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his\\npeople's religion.\\n\\n   But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the\\nSan Jose temple whenever he can.\\n\\n   \\\"When I first heard about this religion,\\\" he said, \\\"I thought, my God,\\nthis is what a religion should be.  They think for themselves and do good.\\n\\n   \\\"People who don't have a tradition, something to lean on, what's the\\ndifference with the lower animals?\\\"\",\"You just don't get it, do you?\\n\\n\\nI think the discussion is more like this...\\n\\nMe: [ happily picking daisies by the side of the road ]\\nBC: [ dancing on the double yellow broken line ]\\n    \\\"Come on out and play on the highway!\\\"\\nMe: \\\"Why?\\\"\\nBC: \\\"The highway was put here for people to be on.

Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\\n\\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\\n\\tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\\n\\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort\\n\\tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of\\n\\tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\\n\\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\\n\\tin second stage.\\\"\\n\\n    This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try\\n    to interpret.\\n\\n    1)\\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\\n\\n    2)\\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\\n\\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\\n\\t\\\"relative wind\\\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\\n\\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\\n\\tnegative angle (\\\"a negative q-alpha\\\").\\tThis causes a little bit of\\n\\t\\\"downward\\\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\\n\\tdirection) and this force \\\"alleviates structural loading.\\\"\\n\\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the\\n\\tmost \\\"delicate\\\" part of the vehicle.\\n\\n    3)\\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\\n\\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\\n\\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\\n\\tthe case if we didn't roll (\\\"performance gain\\\").\\n\\n    4)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\\n\\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\\n\\tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\\\"decreased abort maneuver\\n\\tcomplexity\\\").\\n\\n    5)\\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\\n\\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\\n\\tantennae on the Orbiter (\\\"improved S-band look angles\\\").\\n\\n    6)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\\n\\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\\n\\n    7)\\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\\n\\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\\n\\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\\n\\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\\n\\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\\n\\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\\n\\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\\n\\n    This all begs the question, \\\"Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give\\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\\n    achieve that attitude?\\\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \\\"top\\\"\\n    [Orbiter side] and the \\\"bottom\\\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the\\n    Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle\\n    guy.)\\n\\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\\tHe added that the \\\"roll\\n    maneuver\\\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\\n    maneuver is really expressed as a \\\"quaternion,\\\" a grad-level-math\\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\\n    array.\\n\\n\\n    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT\\n\\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\\n    for these viewers.\\n\\n    If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\\n    It's worth asking if yours doesn't.\\n\\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press\\n    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle\\n    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying\\n    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions\\n    are not being covered.\\n\\n\\n    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS\\n\\n    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:\\n\\n\\tW6FXN  - Los Angeles\\n\\tK6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California\\n\\tWA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.\\n\\tW5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas\\n\\tW6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.\\n\\tW1AW Voice Bulletins\\n\\n\\tStation    VHF\\t   10m\\t   15m\\t   20m\\t  40m\\t 80m\\n\\t------\\t ------  ------  ------  ------  -----\\t-----\\n\\tW6FXN\\t 145.46\\n\\tK6MF\\t 145.585\\t\\t\\t 7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tWA3NAN\\t 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185\\t3.860\\n\\tW5RRR\\t 146.64  28.400  21.350  14.280  7.227\\t3.850\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.340  14.270\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.280  14.282  7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tW1AW\\t\\t 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290\\t3.990\\n\\n    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the\\n    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.\\n\\n    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160.

It is a little known fact that a dog will\\ninvoluntarily regurgitate and release an object that is too large to swallow. I\\nwas told that if I were ever attacked by a dog I should ball my hand in a fist and\\nforce it down the dog's throat. The dog would naturally gag and release, and become\\nmomentarily disoriented. This commonly happens to humans when we go to a doctor and\\nhave our throats examined ( Proof Positive ). In the time during the dog's\\ndisorientation, the next move would be to wrap an arm about the dog throat in a \\nchoke hold manner and constrict with all your might until the dog lapses into\\nunconsciousness ( from lack of oxygen and halting blood flow ). Finally, run like\\nthe wind to get away from the local area should the dog get up again and be really\\npissed.\\n\\nOOOOOOOpsssss.

Though he stepped\\nin it, he has been very good so far about admitting he doesn't know\\nwhat he's talking about, and even more stunning is that he seems\",\"I'm a biker and a dog-lover.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, I want to mention some common sense.  If it's a choice\\nbetween injuring\\u002fkilling a dog or getting yourself injured\\u002fkilled, there is\\nonly one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put\\nthe dog first.\\n\\nSecond, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react\\nto a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're\\nplaying with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which\\nhas hostile intent.\\n\\nThird, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social\\nbeasts, and recognize a domination\\u002fsubmission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are\\ntwo types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which\\ndominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the\\nlatter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible.\\nBut God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may\\neven on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh\\nrapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!\\n\\nNow, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to\\nassume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a\\ngame, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one;\\nwhen you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of\\ninterception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so\\nthat when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to\\nreact to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a\\nmotorcycle is capable of.\\n\\nWith a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures\\nmay be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important\\n-- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the\\nroad, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up\\nnewspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will\\nhurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is\\nthat you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The\\nlarger the dog, the greater your anger.\\n\\nDogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he\\nare not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he\\nis on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.\\n\\nMost dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory\\nwhere there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are\\nsatisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped\\npunishment.\",\"could \\nconvenient\\nthen\\nand\\ncalled Global\\nearth. \\nget\\nmeters (on\\n\\nThought it means Global Positioning System.

STEPHANOPOULOS:  Why don't we just take a step even \\nfarther back from that and look at the whole sequence of events on \\nthe contact between the Justice Department and the White House.  As \\nyou know and as we've said, the President spoke with the Attorney \\nGeneral on Sunday, Sunday afternoon.  They had a good discussion, \\nabout 15 minutes.  The Attorney General informed the President of \\nwhat she wanted to do.  He raised no objections.  Obviously, she had \\nthe implicit authority from the President to go forward.  He raised \\nno objections.  She went forward.  They had a discussion of a general \\nnature about the incident.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Again, yesterday morning around 11:00 a.m., the \\nPresident spoke with the Attorney General again.  They had a brief \\ndiscussion over what was happening in Waco.  As you know, this was \\nbefore the fire broke out at the compound.  And I think that was why \\nthere was some -- just some confusion.  I think that she was \\nconfusing in her minds before and after the fire, not the actual day \\nwhen they spoke.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Then there was a number of contacts at a number of \\ndifferent levels in the White House yesterday afternoon between the \\nJustice Department and the White House.  They were informing us of \\n\\f\\ntheir decisions, what they would like to do.  There was an FBI \\nbriefing in Waco.  The Attorney General had her press conference.  \\nThe President then issued a statement after that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Frankly, yesterday afternoon, you know, there was a fair \\namount of confusion over exactly what was happening on the ground in \\nWaco, and I think that we wanted to be very careful not to have the \\nPresident say anything until we had a much better sense of what was \\nactually happening on the ground.  Once we were fairly clear on what \\nwas happening on the ground in Waco, the President issued a \\nstatement.  He spoke with the Attorney General again yesterday \\nevening.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  At what hour was that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It was quite late.  I believe it \\nwas after he returned from the Holocaust Museum.  He took a tour of \\nthe Holocaust Museum last night.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And he went out to dinner.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe briefly.  Yes, he went to \\ndinner and then he spoke with the Attorney General last night.  I \\ndon't know the exact time; I think it was relatively late.  And he \\njust said, I think as Dee Dee has reported, that he just wanted to \\ntell her that he thought she handled a difficult situation very well, \\nthat she did a good job in a tough situation, and that she should try \\nand get some sleep.  He then, again, spoke with her this morning \\nabout the follow-up in Waco, and about what they're going to do this \\nafternoon.  As you know, the President will have an announcement to \\nmake at 1:15.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did he ever talk with Webb Hubbell yesterday, last \\nnight, or this morning?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was Webb Hubbell the point man for the White House?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Webb Hubbell is the general White \\nHouse Liaison and several people talked to Webb.  The Attorney \\nGeneral was running the operation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did he tell her that she should sleep well, that \\nshe had done a good job?  Or he just tell her that she should get \\nsome sleep?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think sleep well -- done a good \\njob -- I don't know the exact words.  I think that sounds right.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I mean, sleep well has implications as to \\nconscience and whether she should feel badly about it or not.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think everybody \\nfeels badly when you have a situation when --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I understand that, but whether the issue of blame \\nis brought up in that phraseology.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's the spirit -- no, it \\nhas nothing to do with that.  The spirit with which it was offered \\nwas that the entire administration and certainly the Attorney General \\nhad to face a very difficult decision, a very difficult situation \\nyesterday.  And that he thought that she had handled it well, as best \\nas she could and --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, does he think it was mishandled?\\n\\f\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- it was just speaking of warm \\nwords to a friend.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does he think the situation was mishandled?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In retrospect?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President stands  by the \\ndecisions of the law enforcement agencies, the decisions of the \\nAttorney General.  He accepts full responsibility.  At the same time, \\nI think that we all want to look to the future and figure out what \\nexactly happened, do a full review, and make sure we do what we can \\nto make sure this doesn't happen -- this kind of thing doesn't happen \\nagain, or at least we know how to handle it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How much did he know about what she was going to go \\nahead with?  I know that she made the case to him -- explained --\\noutlined the case for action.  Did she say to him on Sunday precisely \\nwhat action?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think it was specific \\noperational detail as to what was going to happen.  I think that they \\nhad a general discussion about the action, about the advisability of \\naction.  I think, as she noted, he asked a few general questions just \\ntrying to get a sense of how things were considered.  But it wasn't \\nminute-by-minute detail of how the operation --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, was it, \\\"we are going in.\\\"  Is it, \\\"we're \\ngoing to use tear gas\\\"?  I mean, what?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe it was that we want to go \\nin and take some action that would increase the pressure on those in \\nthe compound, and hopefully spur them towards some sort of movement \\nout.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, was there ever a conscious political \\ndecision made, or even a discussion about distancing the President \\nfrom --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I mean, we were in \\nclose contact with the Justice Department.  The President accepts \\nresponsibility for this.  At the same time -- I mean, we just wanted \\nto be very, very clear about how this happened and be as factual as \\nwe could be on how the decisions were made.  It is the responsibility \\nof those on the ground to make recommendations.  The Attorney General \\nhas operational control over this.  The President obviously accepts \\nresponsibility for all of this, and he stands by the Attorney \\nGeneral.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, there was a report on the television today \\n-- and I don't know more than that -- one of the members of the cult \\nhad said going into a courthouse that the FBI had started the fire \\nand not themselves.  There was also a picture yesterday on the TV of \\na smashing into the building  where the fire broke out.  And my \\nquestion is, is the White House absolutely certain that this fire was \\n--\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  All the evidence we have is that \\nthis fire was started by David Koresh and those inside the compound \\n-- every bit of evidence we have.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the President ask the Attorney General why do \\nthis now, why this particular date, and did he ask about possible \\nconsequences of either death or injury?\\n\\f\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know the specific \\nquestions.  He had general questions about how the decision was going \\nabout being made.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Those are general questions and did he ask \\ngenerally, why now?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he asked, have you \\nconsidered all of the consequences; have you considered the \\nrecommendations?  I don't know if he asked the question, \\\"why now?  \\\"  \\nI don't know if he asked that specific question.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did she tell him why now in terms of the stuff \\nthat's come out since then about the information provided by the \\nlistening device about Koresh getting increasingly more violent?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I'm not certain how much \\nspecific detail they got into.  I know that she generally said that \\nthis is the recommendation she's prepared to make, I mean, the \\ndecision she's prepared to make.  It's based on the recommendations \\nshe was receiving from the field and after intensive questioning of \\nthose involved.  Again, I do not know how precisely detailed it was \\nbeyond that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is the President's understanding why \\nyesterday?  One of the people who went into the compound a couple \\nweeks ago came out over the weekend with some speculation that he may \\nhave told law enforcement people something that precipitated this \\naction.  Why yesterday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  This is the first I've heard.  I \\nthink what we can go to is what the FBI and the Attorney General has \\nsaid.  There were indications that those inside the compound were at \\nsome danger.  It was clear that the negotiations had broken down and \\nit was the judgment of the experts involved in the negotiations that \\nthe situation was not going to get any better at all.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     There was also some concern over the vulnerability of \\nthe agents themselves who had been working long beyond the time that \\nthese teams normally have to work.  And as the Attorney General has \\nsaid, there was some concern over the fact that they did not have \\nreplacements in place who could stand in for them, and there was a \\nconcern over the safety.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     All of these factors came into play.  They also \\nconsidered the advice of a number of psychologists and other experts \\non David Koresh and those in the compound.  I would just go back to \\nwhat the Attorney General has said.  You have to make the best \\njudgment you can, given the information you have at the time.  They \\ndid.  Obviously, we all regret the loss of life.  It's a terribly \\nunfortunate situation.  We all wish it could have turned out \\ndifferently, but that doesn't take away from the judgments that were \\nmade at the time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, when did the President know that they were \\ngoing to use tear gas?  Was it before the assault on the compound?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't know.  I don't believe \\nhe was given a lot of detail on exactly how the operation would go.  \\nI just don't know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Along that point, George, can you say whether the \\nplan was presented to the President by the Attorney General as a way \\nto end the standoff one way or the other yesterday?\\n\\t     \\n\\f\\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was presented as a way \\nto increase the pressure on those in the compound and, we all hoped, \\nas a way to move some of those out and bring it in -- it wasn't \\npresented as tomorrow is D-Day, this is it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is the President satisfied that, A, he had all this \\nrelevant information necessary to make a decision, and B, that Janet \\nReno had all the relevant information necessary to make a decision?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I think he's satisfied that \\nthey were acting on the best advice and the best information they \\nhad, and he's not second-guessing it in any way whatsoever.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, was there a 12-hour gap between \\nconversations between the President and the Attorney General?  In \\nother words, they spoke at 11:00 a.m. and they didn't speak again \\nuntil Clinton got back from dinner at --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's likely, yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did he call her?  What time did she call?  Was \\nthere a gap between when she called him?  I mean, was he at dinner \\nwhen she called and --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no, no.  I think he called her \\nlast night.  I couldn't swear to it, but I believe he called her last \\nnight.  He just wanted to talk to her.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     what was going on?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What do you know about the situation now?  Everyone \\nhas perished who -- except eight or nine?  And do you know any of the \\nother details?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know any more details than \\nthe FBI reported in Waco.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     watching CNN or how was he keeping track of what \\nis going on?  If he wasn't talking to his Attorney General, how was \\nhe keeping track of what was going on here?  I mean, with all due \\nrespect to CNN, is that how he was doing it?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  There was also -- as I said, \\nseveral people in the White House were in constant contact with their \\ncounterparts at Justice to have the full and complete information.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Who were those contacts?  I mean, was it Mack \\nMcLarty, Webb Hubbell?  How was the President being kept informed?  \\nThat's not a --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe Mack was in contact with \\nWebb.  I spoke with several people at the Justice Department.  I \\nbelieve Bruce Lindsey spoke with people at the Justice Department.  \\nEither Bernie or Vince was also in contact at different times during \\nthe day with people at the Justice Department.  We were fully briefed \\nand fully informed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We were told this morning that the President may \\nhave spoken -- a chance that he may have spoken with Webb.  Do you \\nknow if that's true or not?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's a chance he may \\nhave.  I don't believe he did, but I think there's certainly a chance \\nthat he may have at some point.  I don't believe he did.  I think \\nthat the last contact he had during the day yesterday directly with \\n\\f\\nthe Justice Department was the 11:00 a.m. phone call with the \\nAttorney General.  But the White House was fully informed on a \\nminute-to-minute basis of what was happening in Waco and what was \\nhappening at the Justice Department.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, who decided that the briefing would be done \\nby the Attorney General?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Attorney General.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did you or did the White House communications staff \\n-- were you ever involved with that decision?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  We were told about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did you ask her to go on Nightline and MacNeil-\\nLehrer and all that stuff?  Was that part of --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     there was no advice from the White House at all \\nabout her -- she was on all night, all day.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, and she did a very good job. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why did you decide to have the President's reaction \\nto the situation be only a written statement, which is traditionally \\nthe White House's way of distancing the President from the issue, not \\nhaving him appear as personally saying anything?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, that wasn't the intent at \\nall.  As I said, we had to -- we wanted to wait until we had all of \\nthe information at hand.  The President is also making a statement \\ntoday.  The President made a statement yesterday morning.  The \\nPresident has been fully involved --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  After this turned into less than a successful \\noperation, the only statement from the President was what was on \\npaper after the Attorney General had already given what amounted to \\nthe major facts in this.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was the first statement \\nfrom the President, not the only statement from the President, number \\none.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  After the --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Number two -- well, the first.  \\nNumber two, the Attorney General --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He gave a statement early in the morning when the \\nthing was starting to move --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  And he gave one yesterday \\nand he's giving one today.  Now, the second point --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It just happens this was a written statement with \\nno sort of communications policy or thought process involved?  It was \\nthe President wants to put out a written statement?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Knowing what we knew at the time, \\nwe thought it was appropriate for the President and he thought it was \\nappropriate to put out a written statement expressing his regret and \\nexpressing his support for the Attorney General's --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why was it not appropriate for him to personally do \\nsomething?\\n\\f\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, he did personally do so.  \\nThat is his statement.  It's a statement under his name.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, yesterday during the briefing you didn't \\nsay the President took full responsibility for what happened --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I certainly did.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  No, what you said was --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's just not right, Susan.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, I think you can go back to the transcript, I \\nmean, unless I miss something --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd love to.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     Janet Reno said that she took full \\nresponsibility and you said that she made the decision, that the FBI \\n--\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the President takes \\nresponsibility.  Absolutely.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Took responsibility -- all right.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Check the transcript.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Considering how little was known about what was \\ngoing on inside the compound and, even now, how little is known, why \\nis Washington calling this a mass suicide?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think that knowing what we \\nknow now and given all of the actions of David Koresh before and \\nduring, it is painfully clear that those there were under his \\ncontrol.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It's stretching it a little bit where the kids are \\nconcerned, though, isn't it, George?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that that is an entirely \\ndifferent matter.  I mean, I think that David Koresh must bear \\nresponsibility for the deaths of those children, absolutely.  But he \\nclearly was intent on creating some kind of an apocalyptic incident, \\nand that's what he did.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You're still operating completely on assumption, \\nright?  I mean, you have no evidence, or you know of no evidence that \\nthis was mass suicide.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We have evidence that those inside \\nthe compound set fire to the compound, which led to the deaths of \\nthose inside.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I didn't quite hear it.  This might be Ann's \\nquestion, I didn't quite hear it.  But at what time did Clinton \\nhimself put out a statement on this?  I know Dee Dee said some stuff \\non this at 6:00 p.m., but the President put out --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  At 6:35 p.m., 6:40 p.m.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Right after the evening news went on the air?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, right when we had all the \\ninformation.  We were working on it.\\n\\t     \\n\\f\\n\\t     Q \\t  Dee Dee confirmed this morning that the \\ninvestigation the President is going to announce is going to be an \\nadministration-run investigation.  Why not have someone from the \\noutside to make sure that it's not colored by those who would have a \\npolitical stake, particularly those at the ATF whose actions have \\nalready been --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that clearly the ATF and \\nthe Justice Department will bear responsibility for the \\ninvestigation.  That's not to rule out, as is often in investigations \\nlike this, having some sort of independent involvement as well.  But \\nit will be run by the Treasury and Justice. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you confident that you will not have any \\nproblem getting --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, did the President reach out to anybody else \\nto get advice after the meeting with Janet Reno?  And who else in the \\nWhite House sat in on that meeting?  Anyone else from Justice?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe anybody else was \\nthere at the time.  It was a phone call on Monday, it wasn't a \\nmeeting.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Sunday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sunday.  It was a phone call, it \\nwasn't a meeting.  I believe he might have been there with Bruce, but \\nbeyond that, I think he just talked to the Attorney General.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, you said that in that phone call, she said \\nthat we want to go in and take action, as you said, that will force \\nhim out.  What did he think she was talking about?  If he didn't know \\nabout tear gas, what exactly was his idea of what he was approving?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was approving an action \\nto increase the pressure on --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     q\\bQ\\t   It didn't matter how she did that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  I mean --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What information did he have in terms of how this \\nwould proceed?  Presumably he would have wanted to know, not minute-\\nby-minute, but in a general sense --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he knew that this was the \\nrecommendation of those on the ground and the recommendation of the \\nlaw enforcement agencies.  I just don't know --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is \\\"this\\\" -- when you say that \\\"this\\\" was the \\nrecommendation --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The action to increase pressure.  I \\ndon't know exactly what he was told -- whether he was going to be \\ntold that the tank was going to go up to the left wall and punch a \\nhole in the window, or whether he was just told generally that they \\nwere moving forward in a way that would increase the pressure.  I \\njust don't know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It's hard to imagine him not asking, though.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     that Janet Reno presented him with as her best \\nadvice about what they should go forward with, he would have agreed?\\n\\t     \\n\\f\\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He was -- he did ask some general \\nquestions about the advice and recommendation he gave.  At the same \\ntime -- and I would repeat -- that this was based on the unanimous \\nrecommendation of the law enforcement agencies involved.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, it would seem that this question about just \\nexactly in what detail the President was informed about the nature of \\nthe operation is going to come up again here and elsewhere.  Can you \\ntake that question and --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     get the answer and come back to us with all of \\nit?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you tell us that there was never a meeting -- a \\nstrategy session -- where you and others decided, we will put out a \\nwritten statement from the President and we will have Janet Reno be \\non all of these television broadcasts?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Never.  Never.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And you never called the Justice Department and \\nsaid to anyone or Janet Reno, \\\"you're the one who needs to be out \\nfront explaining this\\\"?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not once.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It just happened that way that she was the \\nspokesman, that no one ever saw Bill Sessions until --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  She made a decision as Attorney \\nGeneral that it was important for her as the operational officer in \\ncharge, as the person who made the decision, to go out and take the \\nquestions on this tragic incident.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  She had no guidance from the White House at all?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We certainly didn't object.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But did you -- (laughter) -- no, I'm sure you \\ndidn't object, but did you suggest it?  Was this a plan --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No. Absolutely not.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     a strategy?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did she clear it?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did she notify you?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We certainly knew about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What happened to this great detailed process you \\nhave for clearing and talking to every public information officer and \\nevery -- under every rock and every place in government that \\nsomething as major as this could have occurred without a discussion \\nbetween you and the public information people at least at the Justice \\nDepartment?\\n\\t     \\n\\f\\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Attorney General made the \\ndecision and the Attorney General wanted to go forward.  It seemed \\nlike a good decision.  It was a good decision.  She did a good job.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Let me ask it this way, George, if in hindsight how \\nyou would handle it?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was handled very well.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You wouldn't change a thing if --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Change what?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The way the White House handled any part of it -- \\nfrom start to finish.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think that's an awful broad \\nquestion and we're certainly going to have a review.  One of the \\nreasons for the investigation is to look for ways in the future that \\nsomething like this -- see what we can learn from an incident like \\nthis and see what we can learn about how to handle them.  If you're \\ntalking specifically about the issue of the press conferences, no, \\nthere -- wouldn't make any change at all.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Two questions:  First of all, on her going on TV, \\nno White House people or outside media consultants came up with this \\nidea?  It's just very reminiscent of what you guys did during the \\ncampaign.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  How so?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I'm thinking of like watching Clinton on Nightline \\nafter the draft story; watching Clinton on --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There's absolutely no comparison.  \\nYesterday there was a law enforcement incident.  The incident ended \\nin tragic deaths of many, many people.  The Attorney General was \\ninvolved in that decision.  The Attorney General made the decision to \\ndo that.  She felt it was her responsibility in the interest of \\npublic information to go out and take the questions of the press in \\norder to make sure that all of the questions were answered, and she \\ndid a fantastic job.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The second question is, did -- as someone who knows \\nClinton as well as you do, can you understand why it's sort of hard \\nto believe that he might not have asked some detailed questions about \\nwhat she intended to do?  In other words, she came and she said, I'm \\ngoing to put pressure on them.  It's hard not to see Clinton, who's \\nfairly intelligent and inquisitive, asking how.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What kind?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Both the Attorney General said that \\nhe did ask questions, he did ask general questions.  I don't have a \\nminute-by-minute account of the conversation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How long a conversation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was about 15 minutes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Telephone conversation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, was the federal cost of this standoff ever \\na consideration in terms of stepping up the pressure --\\n\\t     \\n\\f\\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe so, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, you keep saying that the President takes \\nfull responsibility, but then you refer to it as her decision.  Does \\nthe President not accept the fact that as Commander-In-Chief, it is \\nultimately his decision?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know what this has to do \\nwith Commander-In-Chief.  This was a law enforcement action, not a \\nmilitary action.  And he clearly takes responsibility for the \\ndecisions of the law enforcement agencies involved taken in his \\ngovernment.  I mean, I think there's just no ambiguity about that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But is he accepting it as his decision as well as \\nhers, or is he saying it's her decision?  There's a difference.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As a matter of fact, it was her \\ndecision.  He did not object to that decision.  He clearly takes full \\nresponsibility. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, this briefing has gone on just a little \\nover 15 minutes, and as you can see a lot of things can be exchanged.  \\nWhat exactly did they spend 15 minutes talking about if it was just \\nvery general?  That's a long period of time in a phone conversation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It is an awful long phone \\nconversation.  It was a very important phone conversation.  I think \\nBrit has asked that we take the question, and I've said that I would.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  One of the things Reno said last night is that the \\nbuck stops here.  I think that was her direct quotation.  Does the \\nPresident agree with that in this case?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President says he accepts full \\nresponsibility.  I think what the Attorney General was saying is that \\nshe made a decision, that she's going to accept all the \\nresponsibility that comes to her.  And she's not shrinking from that \\nat all, but neither is the President. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  At any point in the conversation last night between \\nthe President and the Attorney General or this morning, did she ever \\noffer her a resignation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Even before the fire was out yesterday, there were \\nsome Republicans on Capitol Hill calling for an investigation.  Is \\nthe White House at all concerned about the timing of those requests \\ntrying to make political hay out of this situation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  And I don't want to cast any \\nquestions about the motives of those who are requesting \\ninvestigation.  We want an investigation, and we'll have a full and \\ncomplete investigation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In what forum will you answer Brit's question?  \\nWill you put out a written statement?  Will you -- the wires?  How \\nwill you answer the question that you've taken?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, can you remind us what the President was \\ndoing all yesterday afternoon, where he was, and what meetings he was \\ninvolved in?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'll have to try and remember.  He \\nhad a series of meetings with different members of the staff during \\n\\f\\nthe afternoon.  He was certainly monitoring the situation in Waco and \\ngetting periodic reports on that as well.  He did see some on CNN as \\nwell.  I believe he saw a fair amount of the FBI press briefing as \\nwell.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And those reports would have come to him from Mack \\nMcLarty, would they -- do you think?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Mack talked to him, Bruce talked to \\nhim, I talked to him.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, to follow Helen's question, in their \\nconversation this morning did they discuss at all her statement last \\nnight in response to the question about whether she would resign?  \\nDid he say, I don't know why you felt the need to say that?  I'm here \\nto reassure you that you don't have to do this?  Did that come up at \\nall?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if it even came up \\nthat specifically.  I know that the bulk of the conversation was \\ndiscussing where do we go from here and what form the investigation \\n--\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t   The didn't talk at all about her kind of \\nremarkable comment last night about --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I believe she was asked a \\nquestion.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And her response was, if the President wants me to, \\nI will.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Which would be, I think, the \\nstandard response that most Cabinet members would give.  I mean, it's \\na conditional statement.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     have a need to talk about whether -- personally \\nabout whether the President wanted her --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they talked about \\nit.  I mean, what I learned about the conversation was that it was \\nlargely about the investigation itself.  And this just didn't come \\nup.  I did not ask the question if they talked about --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will you take that with the Brit package?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Certainly.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, for the record, does the President want her \\nto resign?  I know Dee Dee answered this morning --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.  He supports Janet \\nReno.  She's a good Attorney General.  She's done a good job.  She \\nhandled a difficult situation extremely well.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, does the President feel that he and Janet \\nReno were let down by the unanimous professional advice from the law \\nenforcement experts on the ground?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  And the President is not \\nsecond-guessing that decision and those recommendations in any way.  \\nThat is not to say that he doesn't regret the loss of life.  \\nEverybody regrets the loss of life in this situation.  But the best \\njudgments were made in a difficult situation based on the best \\ninformation we had.\\n\\t     \\n\\f\\n\\t     Q\\t  George, the 15-minute conversation was the one on \\nSunday, is that correct?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How long was the one at 11:00 a.m. yesterday \\nmorning?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  I'll take that \\nquestion, too.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Were these outside experts that they were \\nconsulting with, or experts within the ATF and the FBI?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You'd have to ask them.  I'm just \\nnot sure.  I know that there were several experts.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And also, why weren't there replacements for these \\npeople?  Is the unit that small?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I think it is a very small \\nhighly-specialized unit.  But I think it's one of the kinds of things \\nthat the investigation will examine.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, isn't there a factor here involving the FBI \\nDirector?  Normally, a president, when he wants to get information, \\ndoesn't only asks the Attorney General.  I know the chain of command.  \\nBut presidents talk to their FBI directors.  In this case, throughout \\nthis entire siege, he has not felt that he could pick up the phone \\nand talk to Bill Sessions, who is from Waco, and get expertise from \\nhim on what to do and what not to do?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he talked to the FBI \\nDirector well in the beginning of the situation when it first broke \\nout in Waco.  At the same time, the Attorney General bears the \\nultimate responsibility and he was getting fully briefed from the \\nAttorney General.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Don't you think the ambiguous situation that \\nDirector Sessions is in has some impact on the way the President is \\nbriefed and on the way that all of this evolved?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I mean, it's perfectly \\nappropriate that he be briefed by the Attorney General and that the \\nAttorney General has supervisory authority over the FBI Director, and \\nthat's following the chain of command.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESS:  Thank you .\\n\\n                                 END                    1:03 P.M.

I think this is poor choice.   The ACLU is\\nessentially a group of auditors: they audit how people's civil\\nliberties are administered.  Traditionally, auditors do not like to get\\ninvolved in the design or operational aspects of things, and with good\\nreason.\\n\\nWhen I was a systems programmer, it always infuriated me that the\\nauditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a\\nsecurity point of view, but wouldn't tell us how to fix it.  I always\\nfigured they just liked to critcize, without doing the work to help fix\\nthe problem.\\n\\nThen I took a stint as an auditor, and I found out the real reason.\\nAuditors don't like to recommend solutions, because it puts them in a\\nbad position if they have to criticize the implementation later.  The\\nauditee can say, \\\"Well, you told us this way would be OK.\\\"  It\\ncompromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor's\\njob.\\n\\nTaking the case at hand, suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar.\\nSuppose that, perhaps through some error on ACLU's part, a key half gets\\naway that shouldn't, and is used to deprive someone of her civil\\nliberties.  The ACLU gets wind of this, and wants to take it to court.\\nBut they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendant\\nand of the plaintiff, which is not an easy position to be in.\\n\\nThere are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors: at one\\nplace where I worked, when payroll checks were printed, they were signed\\nautomatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine.  This drum\\nwas kept by the auditors (who also kept the check stock), and\\nwas brought down to Data Processing when it was time to do the checks.\\n\\nI believe the difference between this situation and the key registration\\nsituation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll\\nchecks:  if they were done yesterday, and someone wants to do them again\\ntoday, he better be able to produce yesterday's checks so that they can\\nbe destroyed.  Determining which of the many requests for key halves are\\nlegit is a trickier process, one much more prone to mistakes that could\\nput the ACLU in a protecting-the-client versus protecting-the-ACLU\\nconflict of interest.\\n\\nAs always, my opinions are my own.\",\"\\nYes it invokes the associated application. That takes but 10 seconds?\",\"Well, actually not quite. Both Radar and Radio-Altimeters measure distances\\nby measuring the time required to transmit a signal, then receive its\\nreflection from a target. Radar generally uses pulses, while Radio Altimeters\\nuse either pulses or a modulated continuous-wave transmission. In the case of\\nthe latter, highly accurate distance measurement can be made. As an example,\\nthe original Bendix ALA-52 Radio Altimeter was accurate to 1\\u002f8 foot at 2500\\nfeet altitude.\\n\\nNote, however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster\\noriginally asked about. The problem with gaining accurate measurements between\\na transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate\\ntime base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter\\ntriggers. This cannot be wire connected, since radio waves will actually\\ntravel faster in free-space (air, in this case) than wire (the difference\\nis called the velocity factor of the cable). So you need to resort to a\\ncommon timebase that is automatically corrected for distance, etc. Something\\nlike a PLL connected to a GPS receiver should do the trick, triggering both\\nthe transmitter and receiver simultaneously. Sound expensive? Not too bad,\\nbut plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort.\\n\\nWhy not go to a different method? Surveyors use a laser-light system where again\\nthe reflection time is measured. Why not try this? (Sounds like something a P.E.\\nshould know about anyway ;-).\\n\\n\\nThis is actually highly inaccurate, since the power output of a transmitter\\nvaries from unit to unit, there are variances in the antenna and transmission\\nline, and the receiver may also vary, both from unit to unit, and the same unit\\nover time. You would need to continuously calibrate the entire system. With\\nthe radio altimeter this is also done, but since everything is located at\\none place, it is much easier to do. Note especially that the time base for\\nthe R.A. receiver and transmitter is one unit also...\\n\\n\\nNope. FM capture effect says that the strongest signal wins. That is, unless\\nthe two interfering signals are seperated by more than 3 db in signal strength.\\nThis is the one problem that makes altimeters inaccurate at very low altitudes.\\nSignals bouncing off runways tend to be VERY strong...\\n\\n\\nAs high as possible to eliminate outside influence, and also to enhance\\nattenuation of multipath signals. Radio Altimeters typically use frequencies\\naround 4 GHz.\\n\\nHope this helps...\\n\",\"\\n\\nGood story, Chuck, but it won't wash.  I have read the NY Acad Sci\\none (and have it).

They are not the standard way\\nto arrest a violent felon like a bank robber.  If there is no need to\\nsearch or preserve evidence they will just surround the dwelling and\\norder the suspect to come out with her hands up.  If the suspect does\\nnot come out tear gas will be used.\\n\\n\\ncomment on the BD omitted\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is not a method to apprehend criminals.\\n\\n\\nIt is a very dangerous method to obtain evidence that might be\\ndestroyed if a warrant is served in the normal way.  It is the most\\ndangerous way to arrest anyone.  The cops are charging into a room\\nand they don't know what is in it.  It is much safer to surround the\\nplace and announce yourself.\\n\\n\\n\\nCops are not cops _until_ they identify themselves as police officers.\\n\\n\\nMost drug dealers and professional criminals are aware of the\\nlikelihood of arrest but they also know how the system works.  If they\\nare arrested they call their lawyer, post bail and hope for a plea\\nbargain.  If they pull a gun and shoot a cop during a raid they will\\nbe charged with first degree murder if they survive the raid.  Drug\\ndealers have guns for protection from their customers and other\\ncriminals, not to shoot cops.  Cops are shot on no-knock drug raids\\nbecause the criminals aren't aware that they are cops.\\n\\nNo-knock raids on homes occupied by non-criminals are more likely to\\nend in disaster.  Mom and Pop citizen _KNOW_ that they have not\\ncommitted any crime, they KNOW that anyone breaking into their house\\ncannot be a cop because they have done nothing wrong.  If they have\\nthe means to defend themselves they may because they KNOW that the\\nhousebreakers are criminals not cops.  Cops and homeowners may die.\\n\\nThe first reports from Waco stated that the ATF had a warrant to\\nsearch for illegal weapons and also an arrest warrant if the illegal\\nweapons were found.  In this case the no-knock warrant was not called\\nfor.  It is difficult to flush a gun down the toilet.  The ATF could\\nhave surrounded the compound.  A marked police car could have driven\\nup to the entrance and uniformed officers could have knocked and\\nserved the warrant usual way.  It this had happened and and Koresh\\nrefused the warrant or drove the cops off at gun point then most of\\nthe t.p.g folks would have kept quiet.\\n\",\"\\n\\nAnd from whence does this right stem, that it overrides the 'rights'\\nof the rest of us?\\n\\n\\nAnd if you want to view that television station, you have to watch the\\ncommercials.

While encryption\\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n\\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has\\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\\ncommercial use today.\\n\\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n\\nA \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n\\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n\\n\\n                                2\\n\\n\\n\\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\nin two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the\\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\nwiretap.\\n\\nThe \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\\nconversations of Americans.\\n\\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\\ntheir findings.\\n\\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\nencryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other\\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\\n\\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\\n\\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\\n\\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\\n          technology to build the National Information\\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\\n          marketplace; and \\n\\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\\n          high technology products.\\n\\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                3\\n\\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\\n(\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone\\nsystem transmits voice.\\n\\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\\nprotect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting\\nthem from those who break the law.\\n\\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \\nThe provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new\\nencryption technology are also available.  \\n\\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\\n\\n- - ---------------------------------\\n\\n\\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S\\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\\n\\nA:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with\\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\\n     conversations of Americans.\\n\\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n     decipher the message?\\n\\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\\n     escrow system.\\n\\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\\n\\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\\n\\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\\n     how strong the security is?  \\n\\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\\n     vulnerabilities.\\n\\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\\n\\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n     officials.\\n\\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\\n\\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\\n     decisions related to this initiative.\\n\\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\\n\\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n     manufacturer that produces them.\\n\\nQ:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?\\n\\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\\n     to other vendors in the future.\\n\\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \\n\\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\\n     the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.\\n     \\nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\\n     powerful encryption devices?\\n\\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\\n     developing.\\n\\n     The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption\\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n     we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have\\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every\\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a\\n     false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n     an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper\\n     Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.\\n\\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from\\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \\n\\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'\\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n     and terrorism.\\n\\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\\n     the government hardware?\",\"\\nI don't know about you, but I have nearly forgotten how to generate paper\\nmail.\\n\\nIf I had e-mail to Congress, I would have written many letters by now.\\nI haven't written one yet, as it turns out.

There\\nwas little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of\\nstate universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII.\\nThe US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was\\nmainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that\\nmany research universities, but they all provided their researchers with\\nlow teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for\\ntravel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and a\\nuniversity wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well\\nas salary.\\n\\nDuring WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure\\nscientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they \\nwere not exactly in the areas of the scientists' expertise.  This is\\nprobably because of the \\\"research mind\\\" approach, which is not to try\\nto find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution\\nemerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to\\ndiscussion about their problems, the job got done.\\n\\nThe military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the\\nfuture, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was\\nunwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the\\nfuture supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as \\nNSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly\\nkeep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations,\\nmaking it more difficult for them to act to support research.\\n\\nThe worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which\\nthe government supports research the university will not provide funding,\\nand in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose,\\nas has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of\\na graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask\\nfor one?  The answer I will get is, \\\"Get the money from NSF.\\\"  Now the\\nmoney at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it\\ncomes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from\\ngetting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects\\nget supported, and how much.  \\n\\nAlso, the government decided that the \\\"wealth\\\" should be spread.  So instead\\nof having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research\\ninstitutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into\\nbeing.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating\\nreseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal\\nhas to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals\\nalready done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am\\nproposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find \\nimpossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrow\\nI may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright idea\\nwhich solves yesterday's too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to\\nsomething I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast, \\nand except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it\\nis not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring \\nmore than minimal attention of a good researcher.  \\n\\nI believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would\\nhave happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government\\nis trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.\",\"\\n\\n\\tYou have only shown that a vast majority ( if not all ) would\\nagree to this.

I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.\\nspec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer\\u002fcounter chip. It is stable down to -50 C\\nand sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time\\ndelay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this\\napplication, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger\\npins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is\\ndisabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.\\nWhen triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x\\nthe timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can\\nbe programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting\\nany combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it\\nis, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K\\nresistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of\\n2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)\\nOf course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for\\n256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.\\nAfter the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14\\nday timing cycle and so forth.\\n\\nPower is still a problem though.

P. A1.\\n \\n EVIDENCE OF ADL SPY OPERATION SEIZED BY POLICE\\n \\n By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer\\n \\n SAN FRANCISCO -- Police on Thursday served search warrants on the\\n Anti-Defamation League here and in Los Angeles, seizing evidence of a\\n nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than\\n 950 political groups, newspapers and labor unions and as many as\\n 12,000 people.\\n \\n Describing the spy operation in great detail, San Francisco\\n authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how\\n operatives of the Anti-Defamation League searched through trash and\\n infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on Arab-American,\\n right-wing and what they called \\\"pinko\\\" organizations.\\n \\n Representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, a well-known\\n organization in the U.S. Jewish community dedicated to fighting\\n anti-Semitism, declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking\\n any laws.\\n \\n Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to\\n gather political intelligence in at least seven cities, including Los\\n Angeles and San Francisco.\\n \\n Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political\\n spectrum, including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan\\n Resistance, Operation Rescue, Greenpeace, the National Assn. for the\\n Advancement of Colored People, the United Farm Workers and the Jewish\\n Defense League.  Also on the list were Mills College, the board of\\n directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San\\n Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper.\\n \\n People who were subjects of the spy operation included former\\n Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey, jailed political extremist Lyndon H.\\n LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft, who\\n is based in South Africa.\\n \\n Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was\\n confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement\\n agencies.  They also alleged that data on some individuals and\\n organizations was sold separately to the South African government.\\n \\n In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from\\n police, the Anti-Defamation League could face a total of 48 felony\\n counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West\\n Coast spy, Roy Bullock, according to the affidavit filed to justify\\n the search warrant.\\n \\n The Anti-Defamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than\\n 25 years by funneling $550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I.\\n Hochman, who then paid Bullock, according to the documents released in\\n San Francisco.  Hochman, a former president of the Jewish Federation\\n Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state's leading tax\\n attorneys, will be out of the city until late next week and could not\\n be reached for comment, his office said.\\n \\n Until 1990, Hochman, a former U.S. prosecutor, also was a member of a\\n panel appointed by then-Sen. Pete Wilson to secretly make initial\\n recommendations on new federal judges in California.  Hochman is a\\n former regional president of the Anti-Defamation League.\\n \\n The league, which initially cooperated with police, has denied\\n repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws.\\n League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an\\n employee and have said they simply traded information with police\\n departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes.\\n \\n But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday's searches,\\n San Francisco police alleged that \\\"ADL employees were apparently less\\n than truthful\\\" in providing information during an earlier search\\n conducted without a warrant.\\n \\n David Lehrer, executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office, said\\n the organization has not violated the law.  \\\"There is nothing\\n nefarious about how we operate or what we have done,\\\" he said.  \\\"Our\\n record speaks for itself.\\\"\\n \\n The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret\\n fund used to pay for \\\"fact-finding operations.\\\"  Lehrer, according to\\n the documents, signed checks from the account under the name L.\\n Patterson.\\n \\n An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to\\n a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending\\n them directly to the Anti-Defamation League.\\n \\n Bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for\\n nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with\\n San Francisco police.  He said that he gathered names from many\\n sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as\\n \\\"Skins\\\" and \\\"Pinkos,\\\" but that did not necessarily mean that they were\\n under surveillance.\\n \\n \\\"I might never see or call up on 99% of them again,\\\" Bullock said.\\n \\\"And it doesn't mean anything that they're in the files.  It's not a\\n threat to anyone's civil rights that a name appears in my files under,\\n say, 'Pinko.'\\\"\\n \\n In recent years, Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police\\n Officer Tom Gerard, who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he\\n was questioned by the FBI in the case.\\n \\n A former CIA employee, Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records\\n and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses,\\n vehicle registration, physical characteristics and drivers license\\n photographs.\\n \\n Using files gathered for the Anti-Defamation League, Gerard and\\n Bullock also provided information to the South African government,\\n receiving $16,000 over four years, the documents show.\\n \\n The file on Times staff writer Kraft, which was apparently sold to the\\n South African government, provides some insight into the hit-and-miss\\n nature of the spy operation.\\n \\n The file notes that Kraft's articles \\\"appear frequently in The Times\\n and are well researched and written,\\\" but little else about the file\\n is accurate.  The brief entry confuses The Times' Kraft with another\\n Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong\\n Kraft's physical description, photograph and other personal\\n information.\\n \\n Nevertheless, the documents provide illuminating details of how\\n Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations, from\\n skinheads to left-wing radicals, searching regularly through the trash\\n of target groups.  Using Anti-Defamation League funds, he also ran his\\n own paid informants under code names such as \\\"Scott\\\" and \\\"Scumbag.\\\"\\n \\n He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast,\\n exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies,\\n including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.\\n \\n It was Bullock's work as a paid informant for the FBI -- while spying\\n on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and the South African\\n government -- that proved his undoing. The FBI learned that he was an\\n agent of a foreign government and began investigating, leading to the\\n probe of the Anti-Defamation League's intelligence network.  The\\n Anti-Defamation League employed undercover operatives to gather\\n information in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington,\\n Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, according to the affidavit and\\n investigators.  Joining San Francisco police in searching league\\n offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of\\n San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax\\n Board.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to\\n cooperate with the investigation, was informed of the searches in Los\\n Angeles but not invited to participate.  Investigators suspect that\\n some confidential information in the Anti-Defamation League files may\\n have come from Los Angeles police officers.\\n \\n \\n \\n From Los Angeles Times, Saturday, April 10, 1993.  P. A23.\\n \\n ADL VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH SPY INVESTIGATION\\n \\n By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.\\n \\n SAN FRANCISCO -- The Anti-Defamation League defended its record as a\\n civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities\\n who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential\\n police information on citizens and groups.\\n \\n But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said that Anti-Defamation\\n League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many\\n felony counts of receiving confidential files, eavesdropping, tax\\n violations and conspiracy.\\n \\n Police have accused the Anti-Defamation League of not being truthful\\n about its spying operations, which collected information on more than\\n 12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political\\n spectrum.\\n \\n Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show\\n that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept\\n files on political figures.\\n \\n Even so, Smith suggested that if the Anti-Defamation League shut down\\n its spy operation, prosecutors would take that into account when\\n deciding what charges to file.\\n \\n In a statement released in Washington, National Director Abraham H.\\n Foxman described the ADL as \\\"a Jewish defense agency which has fought\\n to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80\\n years.\\\"\\n \\n Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on\\n extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing\\n information to police, journalists, academics, government officials\\n and the public.  It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain\\n information illegally, he said.\\n \\n \\\"Like other journalists, in order to protect the confidentiality and\\n physical safety of its sources, ADL will not comment on the nature or\\n identity of any source of information,\\\" Foxman said.\\n \\n The Anti-Defamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its\\n longtime employees, Roy Bullock, was anything more than \\\"a private\\n individual who is alleged to be an ADL 'informant.'\\\"\\n \\n Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements\\n showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through\\n Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman.\\n \\n \\\"Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be\\n distanced from ADL,\\\" Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator.\\n Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment.\\n \\n Despite the Anti-Defamation League's assertion that it will cooperate\\n with authorities, San Francisco police said the group did not turn\\n over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group's\\n offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall.\\n \\n A second round of searches Thursday, this time with search warrants,\\n produced a vast quantity of records, primarily dealing with financial\\n transactions, Smith said.  Further searches may be necessary and it\\n will be at least a month before any charges are filed, he said.\\n \\n \\\"The investigation, of course, will go wherever the facts lead us,\\\"\\n the district attorney said.\",\"\\n\\nOK, I should have said \\\"former\\\" enemy.  I was being sarcastic about what\\ninterventionists want to do.\\n\\n\\nCould we back him without forcing others to back him at the point of a\\ngun?\\n\\nHave you considered a non-interventionist policy?  If market reform does\\nhappen, Russia will certainly get *private* capital at *private* risk to\\nhelp their economy.  They will even have incentive to do so for the same\\nreason.  If they don't reform, then our government will probably\\nconsider them enemies anyway and rather spend money to hurt rather than help\\nthem.\\n\\nThen their's the ideological point.  We want to \\\"win\\\" Russia over to\\nour type of government -- a type where the rulers can rule without limit\\nover everyone's finances?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf a $1.6 billion gift was that important to our well being, couldn't it\\nbe raised voluntarilly?

I think *limited* government\\nis more key than how democratic it is.\\n\\n\\nThat was an opinion, and libertarians are very big on free speech.\\n\\n\\nIf you are pretty libertarian except on this one issue then you should\\nbe VERY libertarian.

Scum has no guilt or freedom to\\nchoose anything.  Griffen does.  God did not make scum when he made Griffen.\\nHe made a precious person and this person chose to do wrong.

Did Griffen intend to support them, educate them,\\n: raise them up to be useful citizens?  Did he have any intent whatsoever\\n: to help these children after birth?\\n: \\n\\nHere's the real problem.  Americans have become so insensitive to the needs\\nof others and so completely wrapped up in themselves that they cannot see\\nstraight or think clearly enough to make even the slightest and most obvious\\nmoral decisions based on reality.\\n\\nIf a man abandons a woman to care for their child on her own, he is not\\nconsidered to be a very respectable or decent man by anyone.  This man has\\nfled his responsibility, has behaved like a lazy coward, and has turned\\naway from his responsibility to his wife and child.\\n\\nHowever, if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden,\\nshe is not thought of in the same way.  When the man abandons, the woman\\nsuffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life.\\nWhen the woman abandons, the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumed\\nout, and the man has no choice, and the man sometimes suffers so badly that\\nhe wishes he could trade places with his child.\\n\\nThs root of this whole problem is selfishness--the arrogance that says, \\\"My\\nfeelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung.\\\"\\nAnd when you come down to it, this is the substance of what hell is made of.\\nIt's the reason a loving God can throw selfish people to the devil and his\\ndemons for all of eternity.  Let any one of us unrepentant into heaven, and\\nwe'll ruin it the first chance we get.\\n\\n: Now, I don't really know the answer to these questions, but I've got a real\\n: good guess.\\n: \\n\\nAnd, it's probably right.\\n\\n: And I wouldn't call *that* 'benevolent', either.\\n: \\n\\nIt is a move in the right direction.  As it is now, we don't see our\\nresponsibility because we kill it and get it out of sight.  The media\\nbacks us completely.  Real responsibility does not sell.  The only\\n\\\"responsibility\\\" that sells in the marketplace is that which is just\\nenough to make us \\\"feel responsible\\\" without showing anything that\\nmight show us our own true irresponsibility.

As you know, the \\nPresident jogged this morning with Senator Wofford.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     At 1:15 p.m., he will have a photo opportunity in the \\nRose Garden to present the Teacher of the Year Award.  At 1:30 p.m., \\nhe will meet with his principal advisors on Bosnia.  And at 5:00 \\np.m., he'll meet with President Vaclav Havel.  There will be a photo \\nop at the top of that meeting; no formal press conference afterwards.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Any questions?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he moving towards some major decision this week \\non Bosnia?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  As we've said, he's continuing to discuss \\nhis options.  He's been talking extensively with his foreign policy \\nadvisors, his Bosnia advisors, as well as with other world leaders.  \\nHe'll try to contact President Mitterrand again today, and he'll \\ncontinue to discuss it.  We don't have any specific timetable, but \\nobviously the situation there is very serious.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has he called Janet Reno today or yesterday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he's spoken to her today.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why does he have nothing to say about this publicly \\nexcept on the piece of paper that was put out last night at 6:40 \\np.m.?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS.

He put out --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Since something has happened he's had nothing to \\nsay.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He's put out a statement on it last night.  \\nAnd we'll have more to say about it later today.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In what forum is that going to be?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It will be at the photo in the Rose Garden.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He will talk about Waco at that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS.

We can talk a \\nlittle later about the exact structure as we work it out.  But I \\ndon't know if it's something you'd want to take live.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will he take questions on Waco at that time as \\nwell?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He'll probably take a few.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is there any reason why he hasn't talked to the \\nAttorney General?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I'll have to double-check.  I don't know \\nthat he hasn't talked to her this morning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And she didn't come here this morning to see him or \\nanyone else?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And he didn't talk yesterday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What's the reaction to her resignation statement \\nthat she made last night?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  She was asked a question about it, and she \\nanswered the question.  The President has absolutely no intention of \\nasking for the Attorney General's resignation.  He stands behind her \\n100 percent.  As you know, he was informed about the decision.  He \\ntakes full responsibility for that, and stands 100 percent behind \\nAttorney General Reno.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The question now arises -- yesterday we were told \\nthat he was briefed on this, but we never got a firm idea of how much \\nhe knew of what the plan was and the justification for the plan and \\nthe justification of the timing.  Was he fully informed on all of \\nthat, all of this about the increasing levels of violence inside the \\ncompound that made them want to go now, the feeling that nothing else \\nwas going to succeed, et cetera?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He talked with the Attorney General about \\nthe decision, about -- she talked to him about the factors that led \\nto her decision.  He raised no objections.  He supports her decision \\nto go forward with it.  He was fully briefed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Of course, hindsight is 20-20, but looking back \\nnow, does the President, does the White House feel that the decision \\nhe signed off on proved to be the right way to go when you look at \\nwhat actually happened?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think everybody feels bad when life is \\nlost.  But I don't think that that is reason to second-guess the \\ndecision.  He stands behind the decision that was made.  He was \\ninformed about it.  He was fully briefed about it and he stands 100 \\npercent behind the Attorney General, the Justice Department and the \\nFBI.  It's a difficult operation and there's -- it had already gone \\non for more than seven weeks.  Four federal agents had lost their \\nlives in the line of duty -- let's not forget that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     This was a very difficult situation and all the \\ndecisions involved were very difficult.  But all the agents on the \\nground, the FBI, the Justice Department all recommended moving \\nforward with this.  They thought, given the circumstances, it was the \\nbest possible course of action.  There's just no point in second-\\nguessing those decisions.  Now, I think that there's a reason --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why not?  They have to --\\n\\t     \\n\\f\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, not to second-guess the decisions.  I \\nthink it's important to take a look at it, to have an investigation.  \\nI think the President will talk some about that later today.  But at \\nthis -- from this vantage point, to second-guess those decisions, \\nit's not useful.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You sound like he's going to order an investigation \\nof what happened and whether --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think he'll have more to say about that \\nlater, yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  He will order an investigation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He'll have more -- yes -- he'll have more to \\nsay about an investigation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What kind of investigation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He'll have more to say about it later.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But in the Monday morning quarterbacking, surely \\nthere is some soul-searching now as to whether it was the right \\ndecision.  You can't say that we did the best we could when it turned \\nout to be a rather -- a debacle.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:   I think we'll -- obviously, we'll review \\nthe situation and all the factors that lead to a very tragic outcome.  \\nI don't think anybody disputes that the outcome was tragic.  But, \\nagain, the President stands behind the decisions that were made and \\nwe'll take a look at the factors that contributed to that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What was the FBI Director's role in this?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, he was obviously involved in setting \\nup the operation.  He signed off on it, as did the agents that were \\non the ground that were working with him.  I don't believe he spoke \\nto the President, but I'll double-check that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But he was very closely involved in every aspect of \\nplanning and so forth?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I would refer you to the FBI on exactly what \\naspects he was involved with.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will Janet Reno be coming over to the White House \\ntoday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There's no planned meeting.  I don't believe \\nthat she'll be here.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  She won't be at this event at 1:15 p.m.?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, no plans to be.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you think that there's going to be a jumping on \\non the part of political opposition to make something out of this in \\nterms of -- to the President's detriment politically?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I would certainly hope that people \\nwouldn't try to use this tragedy for political reasons.  Obviously, I \\nthink, again, that it's useful to look at the facts, to reevaluate \\nthe facts, and I think the President will move forward with that.  \\nBut I think people understand that this was a difficult series of \\ndecisions; that it was a very difficult situation; that it was caused \\nby a man who was a cult leader who was involved in the death of four \\nfederal agents.   And I think it's most tragic that a lot of innocent \\n\\f\\nchildren lost their lives in this.  I don't think anybody disputes \\nthe tragedy of the outcome.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, what was the White House role in handling \\nthe, I guess, public relations aspect  in the aftermath?  Who was \\ntalking -- who here at the White House was talking with people at \\nJustice to set up Reno's news conference, to do all that sort of \\nthing?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think the Attorney General handled her end \\nof the situation herself and made the decision to go ahead with the \\nnews conference once there was a point at which there was enough \\ninformation, I think, to talk with some accuracy about what had \\ntranspired during the day.  Obviously, people here at a number of \\nlevels were keeping in touch with people at the Justice Department \\nand at the FBI to try to keep informed about what was happening \\nthere.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But Reno said that she didn't talk to the \\nPresident, and there seemed to be an indication she hadn't talked to \\nanybody at the White House.  So who --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There were people talking on a staff-to-\\nstaff level.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I understand.  But who at the Justice Department \\nwas handling that for Reno?  Who was talking to the White House?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There were a number of people.  As you know, \\nWebb Hubbell is the liaison to the White House, and I know he talked \\nto a number of people here.  There were a number of people at a \\nnumber of different levels involved.  I don't want to get into \\nexactly who had what conversations with whom, but there were a number \\nof conversations.  Obviously, the Justice Department was working to \\nkeep the White House informed, the press informed to the best of its \\nability as events unfolded throughout the day.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did Webb Hubbell talk to the President?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  I don't know if he \\ntalked -- he may have at one point.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And was the White House role just to seek \\ninformation about what happened, or was it to direct the public \\ninformation campaign that followed?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It was both to keep abreast of the situation \\nso the President could be on top of it, but I think the Justice \\nDepartment managed its press relations on it.  We were obviously very \\ninterested in what was happening there throughout the day, and the \\nPresident was following it very closely throughout the day.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, on that, though, if the President was \\nfollowing it so closely and he had talked the night before with Janet \\nReno, why wouldn't he talk to her at all since then?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, I don't know if he's talked to her \\nthis morning.  Again, he's kept fully aware of what has been going on \\nthroughout the day.  He stands 100 percent behind her decisions.  \\nHe's been fully supportive of her, as he said yesterday morning \\nbefore events transpired and yesterday afternoon in a written \\nstatement.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But wouldn't he want to convey those thoughts to \\nher personally yesterday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  One more time, I don't know if they've \\nspoken this morning.\\n\\f\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  No, yesterday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Clearly there's a perception that she was left hung \\nout to dry all day yesterday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  That's just not true.  I think we said \\nthroughout the day that the President takes full responsibility, that \\nhe stands -- I don't know how much clearer we can be.  The President \\nstands foursquare behind the Attorney General on this.  He accepts \\nfull responsibility for the events that transpired.  He believes that \\nJanet Reno, the Justice Department, and the FBI acted as best they \\ncould, given the circumstances and the facts that were evident at the \\ntime.  I don't know what else he can say to show that he supports her \\n1,000 percent.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  One of the best indications of that is to pick up \\nthe phone and tell her.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, I don't know whether they've spoken \\nthis morning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why can't we find out?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, we can.  I can't do it standing here \\nright now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You've got six people here.  All they've got to do \\nis pick up the phone.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Helen, we'll get back to you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, when the President spoke with the Attorney \\nGeneral on Sunday, is it safe to assume that either she volunteered \\nor he inquired about whether there was a possible downside to \\nincreasing pressure on the Davidians?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that they discussed the situation.  \\nAgain, I'm not going to get into the specific details of what exactly \\nshe told him, but I think that he was aware of the risks involved.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, the President yesterday morning said it \\nwas entirely her decision.  She then said that she told him what was \\nhappening and he said, okay.  Does the President regard it that he \\ngave the go-ahead or that she gave the go-ahead?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think what they both said yesterday was \\nthat she made a decision based on all the available facts.  She \\ninformed him about that and he raised no objections.  Again, I don't \\nknow how much clearer we can be about that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And he said, okay.  The issue is over the \\nresponsibility.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He said, okay.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t   Does okay mean --\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The President accepts ultimate \\nresponsibility.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, the President's investigation that he's \\ngoing to announce -- would that be conducted by someone outside the \\nadministration?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No.\\n\\t     \\n\\f\\n\\t     Q\\t  It would be internal -- is it meant to preclude any \\ncongressional investigation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, it's meant simply to follow up on the \\nincidents that occurred yesterday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And you would, I assume, therefore, cooperate fully \\nwith any congressional hearings that would be held?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  To the best of our ability.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, there are two reports out this morning.  \\nOne that the Justice Department, or FBI, or whomever, apparently had \\na bug planted inside the complex.  And the other is that the children \\nmay have been injected with some kind of poison that may have either \\nleft them unconscious or maybe even killed them before the fire.  \\nWhat do you know about those two --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing more than I've seen in news accounts \\nthis morning.  We may get more on it later, but at this point, I know \\n-- I'm not sure anybody knows any more than what was reported by \\npeople who came out of the compound.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has the President received any report today in \\nterms of fatalities and actually what was going on -- what they've \\nbeen able to find out on in the compound now?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He's been briefed.  I don't think that \\nthey've gotten into the compound yet.  They were still waiting for it \\nto cool off.  I don't think there's much beyond what's been reported \\nin the news accounts.  But he has been kept up-to-date on it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, the President stands behind Attorney \\nGeneral Reno, but does he feel that she perhaps got bad advice from \\nthe so-called experts?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He believes that she made -- he stands \\nbehind the decision that she made.  It was the unanimous decision of \\nher advisors, of the FBI, of the agents on the ground, and he \\nsupports that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What about the validity of the decisions made on \\nthe ground?  Does he back those --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He's not going to second-guess decisions \\nmade.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, you just said, he stands behind the \\ndecision which she made.  Normally, in a situation like this, the \\nPresident says, I  made the decision.  But you're saying she made the \\ndecision?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I'm saying that the President was briefed \\nabout the decision.  He okayed it and he accepts full responsibility \\nfor it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But then why do you keep using the terminology, the \\ndecision that she made, rather than the decision that he made --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Because, as he said yesterday, she evaluated \\nthe facts based on evidence presented to her by Justice Department \\nand FBI, which is part of the Justice Department, and made a decision \\nand then briefed the President on that decision.  That is how the \\nchain of command works.  She briefed him.  He signed off on it.  The \\noperation went forward, and the President accepts full \\nresponsibility.\\n\\t     \\n\\f\\n\\t     Q\\t  In that chain of command analogy there, I want to \\ngo back to Sessions a moment.  Do you know if this was a plan that \\ncame through him to Reno, or was it presented to her around him or \\nwith his involvement?  What was his involvement?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, you'd have to go to the Justice \\nDepartment for the specific interaction between the Attorney General \\nand the Director.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does the President stand behind Director Sessions?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He supports -- again, I don't know how many \\ndifferent ways I can say this -- he supports the decisions made by \\nthe Justice Department and the FBI.  He fully supports the Attorney \\nGeneral in this.  I'm not stepping away from the Director of the FBI, \\nI want to -- but Janet Reno is the one who briefed him, the one who \\nmade the decisions as the head of the Justice Department.  As you \\nknow, the Director of the FBI reports to the Attorney General.  The \\nAttorney General made the decision.  She informed the President about \\nthose decisions.  He okayed it.  He didn't raise any objections to \\nit, and he accepts full responsibility.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you have, based on what you know here at the \\nWhite House, any concerns about William Sessions' performance during \\nthis --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing to suggest that, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Along those same lines, just in your initial review \\nof the situation, how much do you think the problems might have come \\nfrom not having a Justice Department that's fully staffed and having \\nan FBI Director who is still quite uncertain about his status?    \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I just don't think that had anything to do \\nwith it.  I think the agents on the ground -- the operation went \\nforward.  I'm not going to speculate on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the White House express any alarm that Janet \\nReno chose to speak to the live network media before she chose to \\nspeak to Clinton?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:   No.  She was carrying forward her \\nresponsibility to inform the public about the events of yesterday.  I \\nthink she did a very admirable job.  The President agrees with that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Before Sunday, how often was the President briefed \\non the situation in Waco?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He was kept updated on a regular basis, on a \\ndaily basis.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Who briefed the President?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I'm not going to get into exactly who, \\nwhat conversations he had with whom, but he was kept up-to-date on \\nthe events in Waco.  He has daily briefings on a number of issues.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  No, no, was this a regular briefing conducted by a \\nWhite House staff person, or was it by a Justice Department person?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He's briefed regularly by a White House \\nstaff on a number of issues.  Again, I'm not going to get into \\nexactly who briefs him on what subjects.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Another subject?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On another subject.\\n\\t     \\n\\f\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Now we're going to do gays in the military.  \\n(Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I welcome it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How close are you to signing the biodiversity \\ntreaty?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  As you know, the President's giving a speech \\non Earth Day tomorrow.  We'll have more to say about it then.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Any details on where or when that speech is yet?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It's at 11:30 a.m. and I don't know where \\nyet.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, is this a major policy address?  How would \\nyou characterize the speech tomorrow?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I would characterize it as a Earth Day \\nspeech.  I wouldn't look for any major departures from his past \\npositions on these things.  But, again, I don't want to get too much \\ninto what he's going to talk about tomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On or off campus?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is this at a location outside the White House?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It will be somewhere in Washington.  We \\ndon't know exactly where yet.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, what foreign leaders has the President \\ntalked to since Friday on the situation in Bosnia? \\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Only Prime Minister Major.  And again, he'll \\ntry to reach President Mitterrand again this morning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  David Owen said yesterday and Joe Biden said today \\n-- both of them agree that the peace process is not going to work, \\nthat the Serbs are not going to sign on.  Does the administration \\nstill believe that it can work and that they will sign on?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Obviously, the ultimate goal is some sort of \\npeaceful resolution to the conflict in Bosnia.  As you know, the \\nadministration is considering a wide variety of options at this \\npoint.  The situation there in and around Srebrenica and the rest of \\nEastern Bosnia is quite serious.  And the President will meet with \\nhis Bosnian advisors today and continue to press forward on this.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is that a question they're going to try to be \\ndeciding whether or not the peace plan remains viable?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Again, they'll be reviewing a number of \\noptions, including the peace plan.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does the group that he's meeting with today include \\nReg Bartholomew?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he's here.  But it will be \\namong the usual -- Secretary Christopher, Secretary Aspin, General \\nPowell.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, do you have anything on the apparent \\nencounter by U.S. F-15s over Bosnia today -- some aircraft violating \\nthe no-fly zone?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, I don't.  I'll get back to you on that.\\n\\f\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will the President be meeting with every one of the \\nleaders coming to town for the Holocaust Museum?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He will.  He'll be meeting, as you know, \\nwith Vaclav Havel today and with Lech Walesa tomorrow, and then with \\nthe rest of the group tomorrow afternoon.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  As a group, or one by one?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe it's as a group.  Now, Havel and \\nWalesa asked for meetings early and these have been on the agenda for \\nquite some time.  But he will meet with all of the foreign heads of \\nstate that are here.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, has the President decided whether he \\nsupports the gay and lesbian civil rights act?  And has anything been \\nworked out for him to address the march on Sunday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think he'll probably have a letter or some \\nkind of a statement to the march.  We haven't worked out the exact \\ndetails of that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Not a live phone hook-up?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Probably not, given the logistics of getting \\nto Boston.  The speech, as you know, is at 4:00 p.m.  The answer to \\nthe other part of your question is, no, he hasn't taken a position on \\nit.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You said that speech in Boston was at 4:00 p.m.?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe so, yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you know what it's on?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We'll still working out --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  General Vessey's coming back tonight from Vietnam.  \\nWhen will he be meeting with the President?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No specific meeting is scheduled.  We'll \\ntalk to him at some point and see.  We look forward to his report, \\nbut exactly how he'll make that report is unclear.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So he's not going to come immediately to the White \\nHouse?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The AIDS czar -- how close are you?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Still working on it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Drug czar?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you expect it before the march?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't have a time line on it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the President ask Senator Mitchell to try the \\nLloyd Cutler ploy to break the filibuster?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why not?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He's just not going to.\\n\\f\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are Senate Democrats here at this hour?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, that's tomorrow -- tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Update on the stimulus, possible scaling down --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  As you know, the Senate will vote on \\namendments today.  We'll continue to talk.  The President is \\ncommitted to some kind of a jobs package; we'd like to see it passed.  \\nAnd we'll continue in conversations throughout the day and see where \\nwe end up.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When this briefing is over can you give us word \\nthrough the speaker or whatever whether the President's talked to \\nJanet Reno?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We'll be happy to.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It's become a pressing question for the last \\nseveral hours.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, just this minute that I've been here, \\nand I haven't had a chance to follow up on it, Helen.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does he have an opinion on Hatfield?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I mean, obviously, he prefers -- he offered \\na compromise package of $12.2 billion.  He believes that that's the \\nbest alternative, believes that he's obviously willing to take a \\nsecond look at the package.  And I think the Senate will vote on that \\ntoday, and we're hopeful that the President's bill, which will be the \\nMitchell amendment, will be the one that will be approved.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, is there any White House official that \\nwill be at the march on Sunday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Somebody will be there representing the \\nPresident.  I don't know who yet.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, has it been decided how he's going to \\naddress?  Is it going to be a videotape or a phone call?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think it will probably be a letter, but \\nthere hasn't been a final decision on that yet.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The official will read the letter, is that what it \\nsounds like?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Lloyd Bentsen came in here this morning.  Do you \\nknow what was that about?  Was that about this Waco thing?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, actually it wasn't.  It may have come \\nup, but it was about economic issues.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On health care -- is the 17th of May still the \\ntarget?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  That's still the target.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And there's talk about a Joint Session of Congress \\nspeech at the end of May --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We haven't resolved exactly how the \\nPresident will present the health care plan to the people.  I \\nwouldn't rule that out as an option, but no decisions have been made.\",\"\\nWhy don't you ask the approx. two million British Muslims who break\\nit five times a day and have never ever been prosecuted under it?\\n\\nThen ask how easy it is to hold a Christian church service in Saudi\\nArabia.\",\"You CAN print to a file from an HP (or any other printer).

The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\\nversion of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\\nI decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\\n(for better or for worse).\\n\\nI pulled out a copy of \\\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\\" that I had recorded off TV\\na while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where\\nthe Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\\na portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\\nstation. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\\nframes. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\\n5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\\n\\nI captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\\ncard in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\\nimported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\\nkeeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\\nto 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\\n\\\"2.00\\\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\\nframes.\\n\\nI then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \\\"Raw Speed Test\\\" program I used\\nfor the results I'd been reporting earlier.\\n\\nResult: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\\n\\nThat's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\\ntest movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\\ndisk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\\nwas only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\\n(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\\n\\nI modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\\nscaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\\nsize. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\\nobserved poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\\naction, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's\\nentirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\\n\\nUnscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\\n\\nThe other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\\n\\\"preferred\\\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\\nfrom within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).\\nA preferred rate of 9.0 (=\\u003e 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was\\nvery jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\\nease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this\\nmuch overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task\\nswitching.\\n\\nA preferred rate of 7.0 (=\\u003e 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see\\nany evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=\\u003e 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\\nstutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\\n\\nI guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\\nkey frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\\nimprove the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\\neven more...\",\"\\nWhile others here may have had better experiences, I, too, share the\\nsentiments posted above.  Though I have the original Stealth\\u002fVRAM,\\nit is only \\\"relatively\\\" recent that the Windows drivers for this card\\nhave evolved to a point of decent performance.  Note that there are\\nSTILL a couple of modes I cannot use (ie. will not) due to shadowing,\\nmis-drawn check boxes, etc.  I believe the version I have is 2.01.\\nIf there's a more recent release, I'd appreciate if someone would\\ndrop me a note to let me know -- I haven't been able to get on their\\nBBS lately to check again.

We have several\\nNetwork General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on\\nseveral hundred subnets. These are good tools, but they are 1) heavy, \\n2) hard to find when you need one, 3) limited in their software expandibility,\\n4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis, 5) cannot be remotely\\noperated, and 6) cannot resolve names with DNS, requiring much manual \\nmanipulation of the name table.  We also sometimes use tcpdump, but we found \\nit 1) too difficult for most people, 2) did not have enough information for\\nmany protocols, 3) could not be used interactively, 4) could not handle\\nTCP streams and 5) could not read Sniffer files.  However, tcpdump did do\\na reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols, and could be easily\\nmodified.  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems\\nby adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features.\\n\\nTcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 and\\nSunOS 4.1 respectively.  It should work on the same systems as tcpdump.\\nIt compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun.

It's compatible with the\\n    X11 window system from MIT as well as (currently) Sun's NeWS and SunView,\\n    so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems.\\n    It comes from Sun and also with System V Release 4 from certain vendors.\\n    OpenWindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews, after the\\n    program used to start it and the main executable itself, respectively.\\n    It should not be called `Windows' or 'OPEN LOOK' or `OpenLook', as\\n    these terms are either wrong or apply to something else.\\n    A commerical OpenWindows source licence costs about $5,000 for the server,\\n    plus about $25,000 for DeskSet, and another $40,000 for ToolTalk.\\n    The current versions of OpenWindows for various platforms are:\\n\\tSunOS 4.1.1 on Sun 3: 2.0\\n\\tSolaris 1.x (SunOS 4.1.x) on SPARC: 3.0\\n\\tSolaris 2.0 (SunOS 5) on SPARC: 3.0.1\\n\\n    See Also:\\n\\tMixing X11 and OpenWindows\\n\\tWhere can I get it?\\n\\n@ What are OLIT, XView and TNT?\\n    These are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs\\n    that conform to the OPEN LOOK specifications.  See the Bibliography\\n    for documentation on the individual toolkits.  Here's a brief summary:\\n\\n    OLIT was AT&T's OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit for the X Window system;\\n    it used a widget set, and was probably the easiest for people who were\\n    already X11\\u002fXt programmers to learn.  You could buy the source from AT&T,\\n    although you didn't get the same version tht Sun ship.  Sun includes the\\n    OLIT library in OpenWindows (q.v.); it is also often included in\\n    System V Release 4.  It was written in C.  The release of OLIT in\\n    OpenWindows 3.0 was OLIT 3.0.  OLIT support passed to USL (then a\\n    division of AT&T, now owned by Novell), who replaced it with MoOLIT (q.v.).\\n    Note that because of the nature of Xt subclassing, you will probably\\n    want or need OLIT source in order to develop a large application or\\n    anything else that uses subclasses.\\n    [see the proceedings of the 1991 X Technical Conference]\\n\\n    XView is Sun's toolkit for X11, written in C.  XView is similar in\\n    programmer interface to SunView.  There's even a shell script to help\\n    migrate source code from SunView to XView.\\t XView is often said to be\\n    the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with X Windows.\\n    The XView toolkit is included in OpenWindows, and full source is\\n    available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (and elsewhere).\\n    The current version of XView from Sun is 3.0.\\n    Despite rumours to the contrary -- some even from within Sun -- the\\n    XView toolkit is *NOT* about to be dropped by Sun.  XView *will* be\\n    included in the next release of OpenWindows, unlike NeWS.\\n    On the other hand, the XView toolkit is not likely to receive as much\\n    attention from Sun in the future as OLIT.\\n\\n    The NeWS Toolkit (TNT) was an object-oriented programming system based\\n    on the PostScript language and NeWS.  TNT implements many of the\\n    OPEN LOOK interface components required to build the user interface of\\n    an application.  It's currently included in OpenWindows.\\n\\n    The current version of TNT from Sun is 3.1; Release 3 contains some\\n    incompatibilities with `tNt' 1.0 and TNT 2.0, but Sun are committed to\\n    supporting the API, at least until they stop NeWS support some time\\n    later this year and replace it with Display PostScript.  Wail.\\n    You might ask what `is committed to' means in this context; the\\n    answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing.\\n    Sun currently asserts that it is committed to OLIT, however.\\n\\n    The C++ User Interface Toolkit (UIT) consists of an object-oriented C++\\n    class library layered on top of XView and a tool to generate code from\\n    DevGuide 3 GIL files.  The UIT also includes features that simplify\\n    event management and the use of PostScript and color.  It is said to be\\n    compatible with OpenWindows V2 and V3, and presumably V3.0.1, since the\\n    release mentions that it works on Solaris 2.\\n    UIT is not an official Sun-supported product but an ongoing project of\\n    various people within Sun.  It can be found on export.lcs.mit.edu in\\n    the MIT contrib directory as UITV2.tar.Z (use binary mode!).\\n\\n@ Where does Motif fit in?\\n    It doesn't :-).  Motif is an alternative Graphical User Interface that\\n    is being developed by OSF.\\tIt has a `look and feel' reminiscent of\\n    Microsoft Windows and the OS\\u002f2 Presentation Manager.  There are no non-\\n    commercial Motif toolkits available, although the Motif source is sold\\n    reasonably cheaply by OSF.\\tAlthough Motif is currently available on\\n    more platforms than OpenWindows, the OPEN LOOK GUI is almost certainly\\n    used on many more machines, simply because Sun (and SysVR4) have such a\\n    large installed base.\\n    Sun's CD\\u002fWARE Volume 2 contains a roadmap for improving Motif\\n    applications by converting them to OLIT [:-)]; there are also notes in\\n    the `Periodic Table' OLIT demo, $OPENWINHOME\\u002fdemo\\u002folittable.\\n\\n@ What is MoOLIT?\\n    MoOLIT is a version of OLIT from AT&T\\u002fUSL that lets users choose between\\n    a Motif and an OPEN LOOK UI feel at run-time.  It will be part of System V\\n    Release 4.2.\\n    Contact: Joanne Newbauer, jo@usl.com, (908) 522-6677\\n\\n@ What about that Display PostScript thing?\\n    Sun and Adobe have agreed that Sun will include the DPS extension to X\\n    in the next release of OpenWindows.  DPS is essentially a badly designed\\n    hack on top of a slow Level 2 PostScript interpreter intended to give a\\n    very small subset of the functionality of NeWS whilst simultaneously\\n    being harder to use, as I understand it.  The only real advantage it\\n    has over NeWS is that the manual is much smaller, being generally less\\n    complete; DPS is also available on more kinds of machine.\\n    Performance on our RS\\u002f6000 is not suitable for interactive work;\\n    what it will be like on the SPARCStation remains to be seen.\\n    Note that whereas X\\u002fNeWS fonts are shared by both subsystems, the DPS\\n    extension to X does _not_ make Type 1 PostScript fonts available to\\n    ordinary X11 programs.  It is not like ATM on a PC in this regard.\\n    (there is at least one third-party version which does make fonts\\n    available, however)\\n\\nSubject: Window Managers -- olwm, olvwm\\n\\n@ What are olwm and olvwm?\\n    They are window managers.  A window manager is the part of the X Window\\n    system (e.g. X11) that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows\\n    on the screen, and for managing the user's interaction with the windows.\\n\\n    Olwm is the standard OPEN LOOK window manager.\\n    It's included with all of the OpenWindows (q.v.) implementations, and\\n    you can also get the source by ftp, since Sun donated it.\\n\\n    Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a `virtual desktop' (hence the\\n    `v' in its name).  It shows a little map on the screen, with the\\n    currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle.\\t You can\\n    move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys.  This\\n    lets you run several clients (applications) and move the display around\\n    from one to the other.  Olvwm was derived from the OpenWindows 3.0 olwm\\n    by Scott Oaks; you need to have XView 3.0 to compile it.\\n    Get olvwm from an ftp site such as export.lcs.mit.edu (in the contrib\\n    directory; there are three patches).\\n\\n@ Can I use my favorite window manager with OpenWindows instead of olwm?\\n    Yes.  If you use twm, for example, or mwm, you won't be able to use\\n    the Pin and Unpin feature of olwm, and you (probably) won't see the\\n    footers some windows use to display certain messages.\\n\\n    If you use twm, you'll want to use the f.delete function to unpin menus\\n    and get rid of programs that don't have a `quit' button when not run\\n    under olwm.\\n    For twm, put this in your $HOME\\u002f.twmrc:\\n\\tLeftTitleButton \\\"target\\\" = f.delete\\n    where \\\"target\\\" is a 16x16 icon from \\u002fusr\\u002finclude\\u002fX11\\u002fbitmaps.\\n    Alternatively, try\\n\\t# Add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm\\n\\tLeftTitleButton \\\":menu\\\" = f.menu \\\"OL.menu\\\"\\n\\n\\tmenu \\\"OL.menu\\\" {\\n\\t    \\\"Quit\\\"         f.delete\\n\\t}\\n\\n    For mwm, you can double-click on the menu icon on the left of the title\\n    bar to dismiss a pop-up window (I am told).\\n\\n    See the manual page for your window manager (twm, etc).\\n\\nSubject: OpenWindows, Terminals, and Other Displays\\n\\n@ Can I use olwm and olvwm without OpenWindows or on an X Terminal?\\n    The OpenWindows xnews server combines SunView, NeWS (PostScript) and X11.\\n    This means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems.\\n    Unfortunately, it means that some OpenWindows programs need either NeWS\\n    or SunView support, and thus won't run on an X terminal.  This includes\\n    pageview in particular.\\n\\n    You can use olwm or olvwm (see above) on an X terminal or a non-Open-\\n    Windows display, and most OPEN LOOK clients (e.g. OLIT or XView ones)\\n    will work perfectly well.  You may find that you get complaints about\\n    fonts not being found.  If so, see the Fonts section below.\\n    If you are running the window manager built-in to an NCD terminal, you\\n    may have problems with input focus; setting *Input: True in the terminal's\\n    XDefault file in \\u002fusr\\u002flib\\u002fX11\\u002fxdm may or may not help.\\n\\n\\nSubject: Configuration Files: Getting started with OpenWindows\\n     \\n@ What configuration files do I need to know about?\\n\\n    .xinitrc and .xsessionrc\\n\\n    The first time you run OpenWindows, a .xinitrc file will be created in\\n    your login directory ($HOME).  If it already exists, you might have to\\n    edit it somewhat; it's simplest to move it and any other old X11 files\\n    you have to another directory, and then merge the old and new files.\\n\\n    If your site uses xdm, you should use .xsession instead of .xinitrc,\\n    since xdm doesn't look at your .xinitrc file.\\n\\n    .openwin-init, .openwin-menu and .openwin-sys\\n\\n    These are optional files you can create in your $HOME directory,\\n    depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use.\\n    Look in $OPENWINHOME\\u002flib (normally \\u002fusr\\u002fopenwin\\u002flib) for these files\\n    without the leading . and copy any you want to change.  You may need\\n    to edit your .xinitrc to get them recognized.  If you are not on an\\n    X terminal, you will want to run a console window (such as cmdtool -C,\\n    shelltool -C, xterm -C) or Chuck Musciano's \\\"contool\\\" program so that\\n    system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen.\\n    Note that .openwin-sys is not executed unless you edit .xinitrc.\\n\\n    .Xdefaults\\n\\n    You can put X Windows resource specifications in here.

If you're\\n    using OpenWindows 2 on a Sun 3 , probably the best you can do (short of\\n    upgrading the workstation to a SPARC!) is to use xterm instead of cmdtool.\\n\\n@ Why don't flat check-boxes work?\\n    A known bug may make Guide's output dump core if you use these.\\n    A workaround is to edit the Guide output, as it's only Guide's output\\n    that's broken, not the actual check-box code.\\n    This applies only to versions of DevGuide before Devguide 3.0.  If you're\\n    still using an ancient DevGuide, you should upgrade as soon as possible;\\n    the new one is fantastic!\\n\\n@ When I leave OpenWindows, my screen goes blank or my mouse cursor stays\\n  on the screen.\\n    Try running clear_colormap; if this helps, put it as the last line in\\n    the shell script you use to start OpenWindows (e.g. `openwin').\\n\\n@ When I use snapshot, the system crashes, or the server hangs, or something.\\n    This was a bug related to some systems only.

These notes apply to\\n    OpenWindows 2.0, although you could also the do same sort of thing with\\n    OpenWindows 3.0 and X11R5.\\n\\n    Install the X11 libraries in \\u002fusr\\u002flib\\u002fX11.\\tYou can intermix OpenWindows\\n    and X11R4 or X11R5, they're all compatible in this respect.\\n    Put the X11 binaries in (for example) \\u002fusr\\u002fbin\\u002fX11.\\n\\n    Put \\u002fusr\\u002fbin\\u002fX11 last in your PATH, so that you get OpenWindows versions\\n    of programs instead of X11 ones where appropriate, although this is a\\n    matter of preference.  In any event, put the OpenWindows bin directory\\n    first -- see the preceding item for more details on that.  If you have\\n    \\u002fbin (or \\u002fusr\\u002fbin, they're the same directory on SunOS) earlier in\\n    your PATH than $OPENWINHOME\\u002fbin\\u002fxview, you'll get SunView programs instead\\n    of OpenWindows ones!\\n\\n    Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that \\u002fusr\\u002fopenwin\\u002flib is last, after the X11\\n    library directory.\\tThis doesn't matter with OpenWindows 3.0, but with\\n    older versions you'll get error messages from X11 programs if you don't\\n    do this.  The messages are generally harmless (see next item), although\\n    xdm core dumps if this isn't right.\\n\\n    Set OPENWINHOME to the directory containing OpenWindows if it isn't\\n    \\u002fusr\\u002fopenwin.\\n\\n    See Also:\\n\\tEnvironment Variables (especially XFILESEARCHPATH).\\n\\n@ I get error messages on my screen about ld.so: libX11.so.4 not found\\n    set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be \\u002fusr\\u002fopenwin.

If you do get multiple copies, my apologies.)\\n\\nHere is a challenge to Microsoft or Microsort Supporters to defend the\\npathetic state of DOS 6 as an upgrade distribution -- it is a long story\\nbut would make good reading for those who are interested in knowing the\\npotential pitfalls of \\\"upgrading\\\" to DOS 6 that I have been able to\\nnotice after only about a week of playing around with it.\\n\\nMy envorinment\\n==============\\n\\nTI TravelMate 4000 WinSX (486SX\\u002f25) 4M Ram 120M Disk\\nSystem BIOS version 1.03 05\\u002f21\\u002f92 by Texas Instruments\\nCL-GD6420 VGA BIOS v 1.03 a1 by Cirrus Logic & Quadtel\\nAdvance Power Manager BATTERY.PRO v b6.00 by Texas Instruments\\nSmart Drive Cache (WIN3.1\\u002fDOS6) Parameters: 2048 1024 a- b-\\nWindows Benchmark WinBench(tm) v 3.11 02\\u002f11\\u002f93 by ZD Labs\\n\\nAfter \\\"updgrading\\\" to DOS 6, I could not understand why certain things\\nbecame so slow, especially after I decided to try 'dblspace'.  In the\\nprocess of finding out why, I discovered some interesting things.\\n\\n\\nDisk Performance with Double Space and Smart Drive\\n==================================================\\n\\nWhile most things did not appear to slow down most of the time, certain\\napplications appeared to run very much slower.  What was interesting is\\nthat commands like 'chkdsk' and 'defrag' were running far too slowly to\\nconsider them useful by any standards.  I suspected Double Space (DS)\\nand decided to measure its impact on my system using WinBench(tm).\\n\\nThe Real Disk WINMARK of 20350 for the original system (as shipped from\\nfactory with DOS 5 and Windowws 3.1) became 10718 when \\\"upgraded\\\" to\\nDOS 6 with DS.  Thus there is an effective performance degradation of\\nmore than 50 percent which did not really surprise me because I knew\\nthat DS compression must cost something.\\n\\nSpecifically, for short sequential reads up to 512 bytes, DS actually\\n*improves* transfer rates by about 10% (because CPU being faster than\\nI\\u002fO, more CPU cycles needed for DS is more than compensated by savings\\nin I\\u002fO cycles).  However, for all other cases, particularly large\\nrandom writes, the transfers take up to three times as long.\\n\\nWhile the performance depends on the type of access (i.e random or\\nsequential, small or large transfer units), on the average (based on\\nWinBench's assumptions), the disk slows down to half its speed.\\n\\nThe tests alone, done in 'real mode' (see WinBench) and with smartdrv\\non, do not say much except that it helps to put into those subjective\\nstatements like 'there is no noticable difference in performance' or\\neven that 'it will speed up disk access when you have a fast CPU and\\nslow disk I\\u002fO'.\\n\\nThis explained why some applications ran markedly slower, but not why\\n'chkdsk' and 'defrag' (the latter especially) too so long.\\n\\n\\nDouble Space and Windows\\n========================\\n\\nDBLSPACE will not run at all from within windows, not even if you\\nwanted to only to get information, not modify anything, or for that\\nmatter even check on its usage -- try \\\"fasthelp dblspace\\\" in a dos box\\nwithin windows and you will see what I mean from the error message you\\nget.  How narrow minded can a programer get, I wonder.\\n\\nYes, this information can be obtained through the mstools.dd add-on to\\nfile manager, but this 'mstools' dll does not understand a compressed\\nfloppy!  (Use the DOS 6 supplement utility to create a compressed\\nfloppy if you dont know how to.)\\n\\n\\nDOS 6 Defragmenter is incompatible with TI APM\\n==============================================\\n\\nDefragmentation seemed to take too much time.  Even so, I waited\\npatiently till it finished and then ran it again to just to confirm.\\nThis confirmation 'dblspace \\u002fdef' command for the 120M drive should take\\nno more than 30 seconds (much faster on other defragmenters I have used)\\nbut it took 12 minutes.\\n\\nI discovered that if I moved the mouse, defragmentation checking ran\\nfaster (the % figure ticked more rapidly).  It dawned on me that this\\nhad to do with TI's battery saver Advanced Power Management (APM)\\nmodule which slows the clock down when it thinks that the CPU is idle,\\nand it obviously thought DS defragmentation was an idle process!  After\\ndisabling the TI's power saver, this operation took only 20 seconds.\\n\\n\\nMicrosft programmers think TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD users are idiots\\n====================================================================\\n\\nIn the readme.txt file, you can find the the following\\n\\n\\tRunning Microsoft Backup with TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD computers\\n\\t----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\tTo avoid a conflict between the Turbo feature and Microsoft Backup\\n\\tfor Windows or MS-DOS, add a \\u002fL0 switch to the DEVICE command in\\n\\tyour CONFIG.SYS that loads the BATTERY.PRO file. Or, before you\\n\\trun Microsoft Backup, type SETPOWER \\u002fL0 at the command prompt.\\n\\nIf you checked TI's manual on the \\u002fL0 option, you will realise that it\\nmeans \\\"disable all power saving features of your notebook\\\".  Why would\\nanyone want to run a driver disabled!  As I have found out, not only\\ndoes TI's power management interfere with Microsoft Backup as the\\nreadme.txt claims, but 'chkdsk' and 'dblspace' (and who knows what\\nelse) are crippled by the TI's power saver.\\n\\nIt is obvious that there is not such thing as APM specifications.  If\\nthere indeed is such a thing, then either Microsoft programmers or TI\\nprogrammers dont know how to read these specifications.  You dont have\\nto guess as to who are the idiots.\\n\\nBy the way, if you run the advance power management utility, POWER.EXE\\n\\n\\tPower Management Status\\n\\t-----------------------\\n\\tSetting =  ADV: MAX\\n\\tCPU: idle 60% of time.\\n\\nThis figure of 60% seems to be the steady state value on my notebook\\nwhen I am running nothing (windows with only program manager in\\niconised form).  Does that mean that Windows takes up 40% of my CPU all\\nfor itself, and that I have at best only 60% left for useful work?  Is\\nsuch an overhead justified  (whether or not Windows is an operating\\nsystem or just another user interface)?  (In DOS alone, it reports 99%\\nidle time.)  Looks like Windows is a good example of busy waiting type\\nof package that I like my students to study as the classical 'negative'\\nexample of our times!\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft programmers do not know batch programming\\n===================================================\\n\\nI like to structure my startup script and thus have the equivalent of\\naddpath statements like this:\\n\\n\\tset PATH=C:\\\\DOS\\n\\t...\\n\\tset PATH=C:\\\\ETC\\\\BIN;%PATH%;C:\\\\BIN\\n\\t...\\n\\tset PATH=C:\\\\ETC\\\\WINDOWS;%PATH%;C:\\\\WINDOWS\\n\\t...\\n\\tset PATH=%PATH%;C:\\\\BCC\\\\BIN\\n\\t...\\n\\tset PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE%\\n\\nEven though the new dos was installed in the same directory as the old\\none (i.e. c:\\\\dos), DOS 6 installation program modifes each and every\\npath statement, and prepends C:\\\\DOS to its value.  As a result, my\\nresultant path has so many DOS's.\\n\\nIf the installation program wanted to remove the old DOS path, and add\\nthe new DOS path, clearly it has to only scan for the path statement\\ncontaing the old DOS directory and replace it by the new DOS path.\\n(Even this should only be done if the new DOS is installed in a\\ndirectory different from the old one being 'upgraded'.)\\n\\nInstead, the Microsoft programmer (if you can call this person one)\\ndecided to meddle every path statement I had in the autoexec and\\nprepend DOS to the value.  I wonder if Microsoft is so desparate that it\\nwould not fire programmers who are incapable of the thought process.\\n\\nI started a thread on this when DOS 4 came up, and the Microsoft\\nrepresentative in Singapore called me about this poster.  In fact he\\nspecifically said his US counterparts saw the poster and relayed the\\ninformation to him as he did not have access to internet.\\n\\nNow that has not changed one bit.  In fact, if you have a PATH statement\\nwith %PATH% already in it, is it not obvious that the this statement\\nshould not be touched for any reason?\\n\\nAs another example of the inability of Microsoft programmers to\\nunderstand batch programming -- I had the mouse driver invoked as:\\n\\n\\tset MOUSE=C:\\\\ETC\\\\MOUSE\\n\\tset PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE%\\n\\tloadhigh %MOUSE%\\\\MOUSE.COM\\n\\nGuess what MEMMAKER did?  It replaced the last statement with\\n\\n\\tLH ... C:\\\\ETC\\\\MOUSE\\\\MOUSE.COM\\n\\nWhy is it so difficult just to replace loadhigh with LH and its\\nparameters, without touching the rest of the line, I do not understand.\\n\\n\\nDOS 6 Software Quality\\n======================\\n\\nDOS 6 is the only operating system I know, in which, under normal usage,\\nyou end up creating a file that you cannot get rid of using of the\\ncommands that come with it.\\n\\nI am deliberately being cryptic about this:  I challenge Microsoft to\\nuse all its programmers to catch this bug and publish it.  If they dont\\nwithin a week, I will post how you can create this \\\"ghost\\\" file.\\n\\nSurely if I can pick this bug without even looking for it after using a\\nparticular command only twice, I am sure two dozen Microsoft (idiot)\\nprogrammers randomly banging on their keyboards over a week could find\\nit -- that is what I was told how Microsoft \\\"tests the quality\\\" of\\ntheir products.\\n\\nI think it is funny that Microsoft has found ways to \\\"test quality\\\"\\nwhen it is accepted in the industry that quality cannot be tested, but\\ncan only be built into the product.

First, Andrew is correct, although I can see where there might be\\nsome confusion.  It is indeed possible to have two cards *configured* to use\\nthe same interrupt.  They can not *share* the interrupt in the sense that it\\nis not possible to have both cards active at the same time.\\n\\nHere is an example.  For some time, I was short of \\\"free interrupts.\\\"  I had a\\ntape controller (not a \\\"floppy tape\\\") that needed one of IRQ0-IRQ7.  (It's an\\n*old* tape drive.)  My solution was to use IRQ3 (also used for COM2, where my\\nmodem is).  I did this because I reasoned I would never be using the modem and\\nthe tape simultaneously.  When kermit runs, it installs its own interrupt\\nhandler for IRQ3 and uses the serial port.  If the tape drive were to generate\\nan interrupt, kermit would not have a clue what to do with\\u002ffor the tape\\ncontroller.  (And since the tape controller would not be serviced, it would\\nmost likely \\\"hang.\\\")  Likewise, when the tape backup software runs, it\\ninstalls an interrupt handler for IRQ3.  That handler won't do anything for\\nthe serial port.\\n\\nUnder DOS, printing is NOT interrupt-driven.  Instead, the BIOS polls the\\nstatus of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent.\\nThat's why you can have your sound card and LPT1 both configured to use IRQ7.\\nTry that on NT and see how far you'll get. :-)\\n-- \\nKenneth R.

The Order was first proclaimed in 1902\\nin Reuss's Masonic publication, 'Oriflamme'.  On Kellner's death,\\nReuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The 'Jubilee' edition of\\nthe 'Oriflamme', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught\\nsecret of sexual magic.\\n \\n\\\"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in\\nAugsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and\\npossibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist\\nLeague founded by Karl Marx's daughter and her husband.  Reuss was\\nlater associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden\\nDawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to\\nfound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several\\nattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the\\ndevelopment of the O.T.O.\\n\\n\\\"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss' leadership.\\nFor example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin\\nand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between\\nReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and\\naccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,\\nthe initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for\\nthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all\\nthe English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked\\nwhen publishing the material of the Equinox.\\n\\n\\\"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a\\nstroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when\\n_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break\\nin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.\\nover the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.\\nHe had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss's request, deeply\\ninfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\\\"\\n\\n_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX'\\n\\nWithin _Equinox III:10_, Edited by \\n  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,\\n    Caliph of the United States of America,\\n      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this\\nmaterial in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?\\nWhy did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own\\norganization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle\\nof Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very\\ncomplex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room\\nfor very many interpretations.\\n\\nIt is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived\\nout of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters\\nwith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I\\ncan take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble\\nsupport of the 'Law of Thelema' is laughable at best.\\n\\nWould I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  \\nWill I?  \\nI think not.\\nWhy?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection\\nI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things\\nin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be\\nquite difficult to apprehend at first.\\n\\nSo it may be with OTO and Merlinus X'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.\\nI do not support Reuss's words myself, as I am not qualified to assess\\nthem, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of\\nthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then\\nwhat can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that\\nthe Order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or\\ndoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of\\nuniversal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic\\nrequirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?\\n\\n\\nI find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.\\nThey are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane\\nor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  \\nHaving met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or\\nwere very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity\\nof the organization as it stands.\\n\\nI have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments \\nI followed my intuition, and I've found little to stop me from requesting\\na Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I'm happily participating\\nin social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic\\nMass well enough for my tastes.\\n \\n\\nThis doesn't make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.\\nI can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my\\nlimited contact with other members.\\n\\nI urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many\\nways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with\\nthe Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom\\nand the preservation of individual vision.\\n\\nI welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response\\nto other posts in this thread.\\n\\n\\nInvoke me under my stars.

Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research\\nspecifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not\\nas tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am\\nnot competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns\\nout that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \\\"Greek Lexicon\\\" renders\\neach verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical\\norder.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is\\nfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes\\nthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is\\nindeed \\\"chorion.\\\" \\n\\nNow I've checked several Greek-English lexicons:\\n\\n\\t\\\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\\\" Louw and Nida\\n\\t\\\"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\\\"\\n\\t\\\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\\\" Grimm\\n\\t\\\"Word study Concordance,\\\" Tynsdale\\n\\t\\\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \\n\\t early Christian Writings,\\\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\\n\\t\\\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\\\" Perschbacher\\n\\nIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:\\n\\n\\tA space, place, region, district, field, area, \\\"country place,\\\" \\n\\tland, farm, estate, \\\"a bit of tillage\\\", and similar meanings.\\n\\nNowhere do any of these books mention anything about \\\"grave.\\\" As some of these \\nbooks go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books \\nare all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I \\nthink it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into \\\"contradictions\\\" to \\nbe once again, as your friend said it, \\\"lacking in substance,\\\" and thus Archer \\nis again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would \\nhave honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them\\nto support Mr Archer's contentions). \\n\\nBy the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson's) is the definition of\\n\\\"agros,\\\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word\\n\\\"agros\\\" is defined as \\\"a field in the country.\\\" Chorion is specifically noted\\nas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly\\nBullinger's exegisis was, which stated that the word for \\\"field\\\" in Matthew\\n(ie: agros) is different from the word for \\\"field\\\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and\\nthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already\\nadmit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity\\nwhich drives the point home). \\n\\nSo as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise\\n(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this \\nparticular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer\\nquestions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and \\nthe fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in\\ndiscussing the \\\"Potter's Field.\\\"\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler\",\"\\n\\n\\n# I hope I gave you a fairly solid answer to this one: I simply don't agree\\n# with the embodied version of a Satan who is a separate creation or a force.\\n\\n\\n\\n# And there are quite physical descriptions of Heaven and Hell in the\\n# Holy Qur'an, the Bible, etc.  There have been times in the spiritual\\n# and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical\\n# descriptions of Heaven, Hell, and Satan were taken quite literally\\n# and that *worked* for the time.  As I mentioned in the Tradition\\n# cited above, for example, it was sufficient in the absence of a theory\\n# about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the \\\"evil\\\"\\n# which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as \\\"satanic.\\\"\\n\\n     Which begs the question: if Satan in this case is\\n     metaphorical, how can you be certain Allah is not\\n     the same way?\\n\\n# The bottom line here, however, is that describing a spiritual plane\\n# in human language is something like describing \\\"color\\\" to a person\\n# who has been blind from birth.  You may want to read the book\\n# FLATLAND (if you haven't already) or THE DRAGON'S EGG.  The first\\n# is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con-\\n# cept...\\n\\n[some deleted for space saving]\\n\\n# When language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe\\n# another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers, then\\n# such conventions as metaphor, allegory, and the like come to be\\n# necessary.  The \\\"unseen\\\" is described in terms which have reference`\\n# and meaning for the reader\\u002flistener.  But, like all models, a compro-\\n# mise must be made when speaking metaphorically: clarity and directness\\n# of meaning, equivalence of perception, and the like are all\\n# crippled.  But what else can you do?\\n\\n     This is why I asked the above.  How would you then\\n     know God exists as a spirit or being rather than\\n     just being metaphorical?  I mean, it's okay to say\\n     \\\"well, Satan is just metaphorical,\\\" but then you\\n     have to justify this belief AND justify that God is\\n     not some metaphor for something else.\\n\\n     I say this because there are many, many instances of\\n     Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in \\n     the Old Testament book of Job, or the temptor in the\\n     New Testament Gospels).  In the same way, God too is\\n     described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know\\n     one is metaphorical and not the other.\\n\\n     Further, belief in God isn't a bar to evil.  Let's\\n     consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were\\n     metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe\\n     in God to justify this belief.  Again, we have a \\n     case where someone does believe in God, but by\\n     religious standards, they are \\\"evil.\\\"  If Bobby\\n     does see this, let him address this question also.\\n\\n[deleted some more on \\\"metaphor\\\"]\\n\\n\\nStephen\\n\\n    _\\u002f_\\u002f_\\u002f_\\u002f  _\\u002f_\\u002f_\\u002f_\\u002f   _\\u002f       _\\u002f    * Atheist\\n   _\\u002f        _\\u002f    _\\u002f   _\\u002f _\\u002f _\\u002f _\\u002f     * Libertarian\\n  _\\u002f_\\u002f_\\u002f_\\u002f  _\\u002f_\\u002f_\\u002f_\\u002f   _\\u002f   _\\u002f  _\\u002f      * Pro-individuality\\n       _\\u002f  _\\u002f     _\\u002f  _\\u002f       _\\u002f       * Pro-responsibility\\n_\\u002f_\\u002f_\\u002f_\\u002f  _\\u002f      _\\u002f _\\u002f       _\\u002f Jr.    * and all that jazz...\\n\\n\",\"[my stuff about dealing with defferences deleted]\\n\\n\\ni am sorry; i did not mean to.  i think i understand how your\\nexperiences were much worse than the small bit of ridicule i have had\\nto put up with.  i guess i didn't really understand before; now i do.\\n\\n\\nwow, pretty conservative church.

When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian\\nlanguage as unBiblical, I was speaking of Trinitarian theology, things\\nlike \\\"one essense and three persons\\\".  Obviously the three-fold\\nbaptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out.  (I normally use the\\nterm \\\"three-fold\\\" in referring to Mat.  While it is certainly\\nconsistent with belief in the Trinity, the Trinity is a doctrine whose\\nfull formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cent's.  It's unlikely\\nthat Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine.\\nIndeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do\\nnot believe in the Trinity.)  The disagreement over baptismal formulae\\noccurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38, which command baptism in\\nthe name of Jesus.  (There are a couple of other passages in Acts as\\nwell.)  This leaves us with sort of a problem: we're commanded in Mat.\\nto baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,\\nand in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus.\\n\\n\\\"Jesus only\\\" groups baptize in the name of Jesus.  They consider this\\nconsistent with Mat 28:18, because they say that Jesus is the name of\\nthe Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  I'm not the right one to\\nask to explain what this means.  I will simply say that it does not\\nappear to be normal Trinitarian theology.  (It is also an odd way of\\ndealing with the idiomatic phrase \\\"in the name of\\\".)\\n\\nThose who use the three-fold formula don't seem to have a standard\\nanswer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus.\\nI suspect that the most common explanation is to say that \\\"in the name\\nof\\\" need not be a verbal formula.  To say that you baptize in the name\\nof Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus'\\nauthority.  In the 1st Cent. context, it contrasts Christian baptism\\nwith the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism.  Of course there's a\\ncertain parallelism between these passages.  That suggests that we\\ncould just as well say that Mat 28:18 doesn't require the specific\\nthree-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes\\nbaptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\\n\\nOne might well suspect that in the early church, more than one\\nbaptismal formula was used.  So long as we consider following Jesus to\\nbe the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no great\\ndamage would be done by such a difference.  This does *not* mean that\\nI think we should go back to using both formulae.  Baptism is one of\\nthe few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize\\nmutually, so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in\\nthe interests of the Gospel.  This is reinforced by the fact that\\nthose groups that actually use \\\"in the name of Jesus\\\" now do seem to\\nhave in mind a difference in doctrine.  But as I've said before, I'm\\nnot the one to explain what their doctrine is.\",\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKent, with regards to the information contained in the Bible (which\\nis the original context of this thread), Brian Kendig is inside a huge\\nwall.

I\\n   \\u003ewould think not.  Hate begets more hate, never love.\\n\\n       If you are questioning whether or not \\\"hating sin\\\" is consistent with\\n   Christianity; I ask you to consider the following Scripture:\\n\\n       Romans 12:9 \\\"Let Love be without hypocrisy.  Hate what is evil, cling\\n                    to what is good.\\\"\\n\\n       What is it that Paul, through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit is\\n   calling us to hate?  Would God call us to do something that would\\n   eventually lead to hating our fellow man; especially when he commands us to\\n   do the opposite, to love your fellow man?\\n\\n   \\u003eConsider some sin. Now lets apply our \\\"hate the sin...\\\" philosophy and see\\n   \\u003ewhat happens. If we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the\\n   \\u003estronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so\\n   \\u003estrong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to\\n   \\u003ehate the sinner.\\n\\n       That has not been my experience.  I've not found myself hating anybody\\n   as a result of hating the sin that may be in their life.  As a sinner\\n   myself, I find myself having more compassion for the person.  Jesus too,\\n   since the Bible teaches that he was tempted in every way that we are, is\\n   able to have compassion on us when we our tempted and fall.  Jesus is our\\n   very example of HOW to hate the sin but love the sinner.  In the account of\\n   the woman caught in adultery (John 8), Jesus had compassion on the woman;\\n   BUT he also called her to leave her life of sin.  This is what it means to\\n   love sinners but hate their sin; it means loving them unconditionally,\\n   while at the same time calling them to leave their sin.\\n\\n   \\u003eIn addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and do things\\n   \\u003ewhich are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even believe\\n   \\u003ewhat they are doing is a sin).\\n\\n       The blame for this can not always be laid at the feet of the\\n   Christian.  I have seen and been guilty of taking offense by someone merely\\n   pointing out my sin and calling me to repent of it.  It was not unloving\\n   for the Christian to call me out of sin; in fact, I believe it was the most\\n   loving thing that that person could have done.  He loved me enough to want\\n   to spare me the consequence of remaining in my sin.\\n\\n   \\u003eAfter enough of this, the sinner begins to hate us (they certainly don't\\n   \\u003elove us for our constant criticism of their behavior). Hate builds up and\\n   \\u003edrives people away from God...this certainly cannot be a good way to build\\n   \\u003elove.\\n\\n       Again, I don't think that you can lay the blame for this at the feet of\\n   the Christian.  If we have loved them as Jesus loved sinners (exemplified\\n   in John 8) and the sinner hates us for it, then we have done the best we\\n   can.

In the meantime everyone he mentions has died\\nand attempts to find actual written sources behind the text have come up\\nwith only the we section of the later portion of acts as firmly established.\\nMoreover, Pauls account of some of the events in Acts (as recorded in \\nGalatians) fail to establish the acts accounts. \\n\\nWhat we need, therefore, is a reliable text, critically appreciated, which\\ndocuments the death of Christians for belief in the Resurrection.

Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he\\ntells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if you\\ndefy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes\\nsense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if you\\ndon't.

But,\\n   amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews\\n   and of Judaism.\\n        The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup\\n   of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of\\n   the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out\\n   of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if\\n   they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have\\n   intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into\\n   their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few\\n   generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a\\n   disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into\\n   the Promised Land.\\n        Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered\\n   sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,\\n   destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of\\n   the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would\\n   be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.\\n   Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of\\n   assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the\\n   worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility\\n   cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human\\n   sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never\\n   again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.\\n   Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the\\n   Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.\\n        Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming\\n   simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only\\n   prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem\\n   every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,\\n   with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place\\n   of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the\\n   Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in\\n   danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,\\n   that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the\\n   controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish\\n   people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge\\n   of all humans everywhere.\\n        Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by\\n   that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather\\n   the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined\\n   to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and\\n   the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might\\n   think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.\\n   The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah\\n   portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage\\n   from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss\\n   that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of\\n   Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)\\n   were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it\\n   had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would\\n   probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism\\n   saved them.\\n\\n        [Other examples here omitted for brevity's sake.]\\n\\n        Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became\\n   famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR\\n   LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,\\n   everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on\\n   stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the\\n   studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast\\n   Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she\\n   later realized that if she had played the screen role, she\\n   would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.\\n   It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney\\n   offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for\\n   it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking\\n   at Walt Disney, she said, \\\"And now, my special thanks to the\\n   man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!\\\" It was the most\\n   memorable line of the evening.\\n        In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in\\n   the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive\\n   to this day, beginning with Joseph's brothers, and continuing\\n   with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus\\n   Epiphanes....\\n\\nAfter the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him\\nprivately and said, \\\"You were talking about the Holocaust, weren't\\nyou?\\\" He answered, \\\"If that is an example that came to your mind,\\nthen you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would not\\ntalk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it.\\\" I assume\\nthat he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been no\\nstate of Israel.\\n\\nSomeone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusion\\nthat God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His\\npurposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  go\\non to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God's doing -- that He\\nstirred up Joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him, and\\nthat when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh's\\nheart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go.\\nAnd this raises questions about how an action can be considered\\nwicked and at the same time be considered something that God has\\nbrought about.\\n\\nI suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has\\na log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log,\\ninstead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot\\nthat spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers\\nthe wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the\\nknot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color\\nof the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that\\nobservers will say: \\\"How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a\\npiece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its\\npresence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a\\ngreat work of art.\\\" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was\\nlooking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not\\ncontained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art,\\nbut a different one. So, if Joseph's brothers had not sold him, God\\nwould still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people,\\nbut He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not\\nbetrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected\\nJesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if\\nPilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set\\nJesus free, it might appear that there would have been no\\nCrucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no\\nSalvation. Not so. God did not need Judas' sin to redeem us. If\\nJudas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled\\nthe world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know\\nhow Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its\\ninterior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and\\njust as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth\\ngame agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops\\nand had attacked Fisher's knight instead (don't bother to look up\\nthe game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is\\nnone the less valid).\\n\\nThus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of\\nPilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice\\nwas not God's doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God's\\nplans by behaving justly and courageously.\\n\\nWhat, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, \\\"I\\nwill harden Pharaoh's heart, so that he will not let the people go\\\"?\\nSome Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet\\nwith God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty\\nwere not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose rather\\nthat what God was telling Moses was something like this: \\\"If you see\\nthat Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be\\ndiscouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. My\\npurposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and\\nlet the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit his\\nresistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future\\nhistorians and theologians will suppose that I would have been\\nthrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.\\\"\\n\\nTo return to the question that started this all off. Is it possible\\nthat the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, are\\ninstruments of God's will?\\n     First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what\\nJoseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong.\\nThey intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that\\ndoes not make them any less subject to just condemnation and\\npunishment.\\n     Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not\\nthe same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had\\nrefrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the\\ngood He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.\",\"\\n\\nI was at my parents' Seder and noticed the labelling on one of the \\npackages was English, Hebrew and French.

I summarised the problem by writing \\\"There\\nis no way out of the loop.\\\"\\n\\n\\nSomeone called `REXLEX' has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop, but\\nhe did not bother to explain what it was, preferring instead to paraphrase\\nSartre, ramble about Wittgenstein, and say that the conclusion of my argument\\nleads to relativism.\\n\\nAs I have explained to him before, you cannot reject an argument as false\\nbecause you dislike where it leads: the facts do not change just because\\n\\n\\nHowever, as any first-year philosophy student can explain, what `REXLEX' has\\nwritten does not constitute a refutation.  All he has said is that he does\\nnot like what I wrote -- he has done nothing at all to dispute it.\\n\\n *\\n\\nThere were two sentences in `REXLEX's post that seemed relevant to the\\npoint at hand:\\n\\n\\nI do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience.  I\\nhave, for example, direct experience of adding numbers.  I don't claim to\\nbe infallible at it -- in fact I remember doing sums incorrectly -- but I\\ndo claim that I have direct experience of reasoning about numbers.\\n\\nHowever, once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about\\nthem, we are on much shakier ground.  That was the point of the earlier\\narticle.  Human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trusted\\nin very limited circumstances.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops, and your own\\nreasoning begins, possibility for error appears.\\n\\nFor example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations include a\\nperfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, and that Jesus said,\\nexactly, \\\"This is my body.\\\"\\n\\nWe'll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely\\ntrue.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.\\n\\nAt the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the\\npossibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do\\nnot have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of\\nTran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passage\\nusing our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know\\nthat our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This\\nis something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)\\n\\nWhy should anyone believe that his reasoning -- which he knows to be\\nfallible -- can lead him to perfect conclusions?\\n\\nSo, given the assumptions in this example, what we can be certain of is\\nthat Jesus said \\\"This is my body.\\\"  Beyond that, once we start making up\\ndoctrines and using our brains to reason about what Christ revealed, we\\nget into trouble.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain\\nof.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they\\ncannot be certain.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat is the problem of seeming arrogant.  The non-Christians around us know\\nthat human beings make mistakes, just as surely as we know it.  They do not\\nbelieve we are infallible, any more than we do.\\n\\nWhen Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead\\nthem astray -- when we implicitly claim that we are infallible -- the non-\\nChristians around us rarely believe that implicit claim.  Witnessing is\\nhardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you\\nare either too foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying\\nto cover them up.\\n\\nI think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what\\nthings we are only \\\"very confident\\\" of.  For example, we might say that we\\nknow our sin, for recognising sin is something we directly experience.  But\\nother things, whether based on reasoning from Scripture or extra-Biblical\\nthinking, should not be labled as infallible: we should say that we are\\nvery confident of them, and be ready to explain our reasoning.\\n\\nBut, so far as I am aware, none of us is infallible -- speaking or acting\\nas if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous.\\n\\n *\\n\\n`REXLEX' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Silent_, by\\nFrancis Schaeffer.  I didn't think very highly of it, but I think that\\nMr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Christians.  Somebody\\nelse might like it, though, so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it.\\n\\nIf someone is interested in my opinion, I'd suggest _On Certainty_, by\\nLudwig Wittgenstein.\\n\",\"The Sophomore\\n          (Romans 1:22)\\n\\nThe sophomore says, ``What is truth?''\\nand turns to bask in the admiration of his peers.\\n\\nHow modern how daring how liberating\\nHow modern how daring how liberating\\nthey chant\\n\\nThe sophomore, being American\\nDoesn't know\\nThat his ``question''\\n\\n   modern\\n       skeptical\\n           cynical\\n\\nWas asked before, by a\\n\\n   modern\\n       skeptical\\n           cynical\\n   urbane cosmopolitan\\n\\nPolitician (appointed not elected)\\nWho happened to live two thousand years ago.\\n\\nLike many politicians he cared\\n\\n    Less about ideals\\n         than results\\n\\n    Less about ends\\n         than means\\n\\n    Less about anything\\n         than keeping his job\\n              (and his head).\\n\\nWe might call him\\nA bit brutal\\nThough `firm' would be kinder\\n(And no doubt Stalin, who let nobody go, laughed at his laxness)\\nHe didn't like his job; perhaps he no longer hoped for better\\n(Nor feared worse, except regarding his head).\\n\\nAnd when these wily Jews\\nWith their heads-I-win, tails-you-lose\\n     conundrums\\nBrought forth their madman,\\nHis first impulse was to play the Roman:\\n``I find nothing wrong with him,\\n  See to it yourselves.''\\n\\nBut when they mentioned `King' and `Caesar'\\nHis heart froze.\\n\\nIf he killed their madman\\n    He'd start a riot\\n         and lose his job\\n             (and his head)\\n\\nIf he saved the King of the Jews\\n    He'd piss off Caesar\\n         and lose his job\\n             (and his head)\\n\\nAnd when his wife told him to have\\n   Nothing to do with the righteous lout\\nShe didn't tell him anything\\n   He hadn't already figured out.\\n\\nSo he punted.\\n\\n``Not my jurisdiction!

If Mary was Immaculately concieved, so she\\n   could be a pure vessel, does this mean that she was without sin\\n   and, therefore, the perfect (meaning sinless) female human being?\\n   Is this why she is held so highly in the Catholic Church despite\\n   it's basically patriarchical structure?\\n\\nShe was immaculately conceived, and so never subject to Original Sin,\\nbut also never committed a personal sin in her whole life.  This was\\npossible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by God.\\n\\nShe is regarded so highly because of her special relationship to God,\\nand everything that flows from that relationship.\\n\\nThe Catholic Church sees her as the new Eve.

I'm going to count on the supposition that you think\\nthrough the opinions you have - something which is, by the way, against\\nmy better judgment based on what I've seen from you to date.  We are\\nagreed, aren't we, that dictionaries are *reference books* for the usage\\nof a given language, and in particular for the meanings of the words and\\nphrases which comprise that language?  Now, you are using meanings\\ncompletely different from, indeed in some cases diametrically different\\nfrom, those given in the dictionary.  As a reference book, a dictionary\\ncontains those meanings in both past and (as much as it can) in current\\nuse.  That's also why they are updated so often.  Now, if you are saying\\nthings which you give different meanings than the dictionary does, and\\nusing non-standard meanings about every word, what is your chance of\\nbeing taken at face value...?\\n\\nJust about none.  Just about no one will take you that way because the\\nwords mean something different to them.  It's quite clear to me from\\nthe response this thread has been getting that that is exactly what is\\nhappening.  Ponder that.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat you did was ask a leading question.  In English idiom, the phrase\\n\\\"and guess why...\\\" in the way you used it is a loaded question, with\\nonly one answer expected.  \\n\\nI also take offense at being told I cannot read by someone who is\\nobviously having trouble with the subject himself.  Mr. Pinkas, I am a\\nPhD candidate in my field.  One does not get to PhD candidacy if one\\ncannot read.  \\n\\n\\nBalderdash.  You know this is false.  I would be able to make the\\nabstraction if it bore any resemblance to the facts of the matter.\\nYours did not.  The analogy is utterly inapplicable.\\n\\nI wouldn't be in the field I'm in -- astrophysics -- if I couldn't make\\nabstractions and speculate about the general grand scheme of things.

I mean, it was the\\nFinnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous\\npenalties the Canadien ref called in the last period. The Germans got a\\nmatch penalty and a 10 minutes misconduct for practically nothing and\\nseconds after that the German goalie got two minutes for \\\"delay of game\\\"\\nfor a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd. The resulting 5:3\\nskating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point, when the Germans\\nwere starting to come up strong.\\nI am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in German sports events.\\nIf you watch for example a tennis Davis Cup match the players are often not\\nable to play for minutes, because the crowd is so obnoxious. But I have to\\nadmit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most\\nother countries (you should go to the US and watch the way they present the\\nOlympics on television; or the soccer crowds in England; or the Finnish\\nspectators at nordic skiing events.....). I mean it makes me sick to see\\nall this nationalism all over the world and I would rather see the best\\nteam\\u002fplayer win and get cheared at. I do not mind if my favorite team\\nlooses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and I have to\\nadmit that in most sports the German national site is not my favorite team\\nto watch (the German soccer team is boring to watch, for example).\\nBut, reading the above posting, I think that you are on the same level as\\nthese crowds you are criticizing. It is easy to talk of (nearly all)\\nGermans as Nazis and nationalists; thats the kind of propaganda that all\\nultraconservative people use against Germany. It is true that there is a\\ngreat danger of re-arising nationalism in Germany but from my experience\\nmost of the people (at least of the people that i know) also regard this as\\na big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now. Why can't we\\njust look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers\\ncorresponding to their nationality (eg. all Russians are Communists; all\\nAmericans are Capitalists; all Germans are Nazis, all Fins are hanging\\naround beeing drunk on ferries...). \\nIn my opinion, your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that you\\ndon't seem to be different from the Nazis you are talking about.\\n\\nThomas\\n\",\"In  \\u003c1qvos8$r78@cl.msu.\\u003e, vergolin@euler.lbs.msu.edu (David Vergolini) writes...\\n\\nThere's quite a few Wings fans lurking about here, they just tend\\nto be low key and thoughtful rather than woofers.

We all know the Caps\\nare famous lead blowers in crucial playoff games. Examples:\\n\\n1) game 4 against the Isles, 1985, led 4-2 after two, lead series 2-1,\\ngave up 4 goals in the 3rd period, including the game winning goal in the\\nlast minute. After that goal, Bobby Carpenter botched a penalty shot.\\nSeries tied 2-2, lost game 5 a few days later.\\n\\n2) game 4 against the Rangers, 1986, led series 2-1, led by 2 in the 3rd \\nperiod, blew it. Lost game in OT and three consecutive games.\\n\\n3) game 6 against Pittsurgh, 1992, led series 3-2, led by 2 in 2nd period.\\nBlew it and the series.\\n\\n4) game 3 against Isles, 1993, series tied 1-1, led by 2 after 2. Blew it.\\n\\n5) game 4 against Isles, 1993, trailed series 2-1, led by 3 in 2nd period.\\nBlew it again.\\n\\nWhen they were leading by 3 in game 4, I said to myself: \\\"if they blew this\\nlead, the series is OVER\\\". They have lost all the momemtum. The Islanders\\nbelieve they can come back no matter what the score is.\\n\\nI am still waiting for a Cap goalie who can carry the team, who can \\ncompletely shut down the opposition when they are hanging on their dear \\nlives in a crucial game.\\n\\nWell, some teams such have it and some teams just don't. When the Caps\\nwere frustrated year in year out by the Islanders, I was thinking \\\"wait\\nuntil Potvin\\u002fBossy\\u002fTrottier\\u002fSmith retire\\\".

My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book. \\n\\n\\nYou can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it.  But my point is that\\nit wasn't Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e.\\na winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And\\nbefore anybody jumps in and says I'm nit-picking and mincing words, go back\\nand read from where this thread started...\\n\\nIt might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind who suddenly\\nfound an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it \\\"gee, Mario Lemieux is\\namazing, I'll go watch him play\\\", or was it \\\"gee, now we've got a *kick*\\n*ass* guy on *our* side, I'll go watch him play\\\".  I think it was the latter.\\n\\n\\nI don't think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people don't go to\\nthe games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket\\nholders in LA don't always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings\\ninitial success following Gretzky's arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)\\nand corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in\\nattendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  \\n\\nWhether or not the Kings are a 'winner' is debatable.  I claim that since\\nGretzky's arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim\\nthat McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler\\ndynasty...but that's another story and included only because I don't like\\nMcNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and\\nthat undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising\\nsales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little\\ntailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the\\nForum even if the tickets were sold.\\n\\n\\nFor the short term, IMO.  Although I think that it's inevitable that the team\\nwill improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because they\\nmake people around them better.\\n\\n\\nWell, at least we are in full agreement here!\\n\\n\\nSo are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? \\u003ccouldn't resist...\\u003e\\n\\n\\nYes, but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type of\\nreasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people\\nshowing up at Winnipeg games.  It's difficult to predict, but do you think\\nthat if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they\\nwill maintain their attendance levels?

Olson was still\\nrecovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe),\\nand there were questions as to whether he would be\\nable to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.\\n\\nI was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez\\ncan hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was\\nthe Braves \\\"Defensive Catcher\\\" prospect, while Brian Deak was\\nthe Braves \\\"Offensive Catcher\\\" prospect.  Besides, Olson\\nand Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard\\nbox, and don't walk enough to be useful.\\n\\nBut Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went\\nwith the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down\\nat the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back.\\n\\n2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.\\nAfter all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and\\ntear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher\\n(California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to\\nmove Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.\\nPlus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn't\\ntiddleywinks either (I think Olson's at about $800,000, Berryhill\\nat $450,000, but that's only what I recall).\\n\\n3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to\\nplay in this also.  What is it, that 5\\u002f6 of the 2+year players\\naren't eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1\\u002f6 that were on the roster\\nthe longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change,\\nbut the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business\\nstandpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June\\u002fthe\\nfirst time Olson\\u002fBerryhill go on the DL.\\n\\n4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the team.\\nI still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,\\nand the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field,\\nwhich, IMO, includes Lopez.\\n\\nOf course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won't need him. ;)\\n\\nAs for the Schuerholz\\u002fCox conversation, I imagine it went\\nlike this:  (Remember, they've BOTH been GM's)\\n(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)\\n\\nCox:  OK, we've sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a\\nlittle smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding\\nis better than it used to be.\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Well, we'll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion\\njust won't sign that baseball only contract.  We can't count\\non him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the\\ndefense.  Besides, Gorman's not ready to give up on\\nBilly Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs,\\nwe can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to\\ngive us some pitching depth in 1995.\\n\\nCox:  Yep, that'll be nice.  Too bad Deion won't sign.\\nOK, I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts having\\nBerry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about\\nKlesko?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil\\nfor Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money\\nor Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,\\nbut somehow he doesn't seem to be the same GM.  First\\nJeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he\\ngets rid of Brian Jordan, then I'd HAVE to believe that he\\nand Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!\\n\\nCox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I'll wait til the trading\\ndeadline for my Hunter\\u002fKlesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few\\nextra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...\\nif Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.\\nAnd if that doesn't work, then perhaps Sid's knees\\ncould be \\\"persuaded\\\" to act up.  There's always the\\n15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!\\n\\nSchuerholz:  What about Caraballo?\\n\\nCox:  Well, he's not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts\\nin Richmond, he'll start walking more.  Besides, if he's going to be\\narbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually\\nget some value from him before he makes the big bucks.\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Now, let's see.  That leaves Lopez.\\n\\nCox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn't think Olson\\nwould recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into\\nrunning into him again?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he'll get\\n$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one\\nextra year.  Besides, until Olson's shown his stuff a little\\nbit, I can't trade him.  Besides, Berryhill's a left-handed\\nhitter.  You know how rare that is?\\n\\nCox:  Don't you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common,\\nif you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in\\nthe World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Hey, you're the one who wouldn't write Lopez\\ninto the lineup.\\n\\nCox:  Well, you're the one who went out and got me Jeff\\nReardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn't be used\\nto our pitching staff's stuff.  He got some time with\\nthem this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely\\nwe only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep\\nwill be hurt by May.\\n\\nCox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely\\none of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I\\ncan call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant!\\nTHE WORLD SERIES!

Mwa-ha-ha-ha!\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Easy, Bobby.  Have you been taking those\\n\\\"happy pills\\\" left around by Chuck Tanner?

What you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays\\nreally well, he 'stores up' mistakes that can be used at a later time.  Ths\\nis not so.  Roy is the 'villain', as you so succinctly put it, because he\\nallowed a very cheap goal.  If you think Roy outplayed Hextall, perhaps you\\nshould get a tape of the game and watch the first 7-8 minutes of the third\\nperiod.  NHL goaltenders _make_ some great saves.  If they did not, they\\nwould not be in the NHL in the first place.  I do not expect any particular\\ngoalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time, even though they\\nare occasionally required.  However, when it comes to a routine shot like\\nSakic's, especially at such a crucial time in a game, I don't think there \\nare any legitimate excuses. \\n\\n\\nI am not arguing that Hextall was brilliant.  I am arguing is that a\\nrelatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result \\nin a goal. \\n\\n\\nIn a one-goal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as\\n'just the 1 goal'.  I have not defended Dionne for taking the penalty\\neither...in fact I think it was a boneheaded move.  But it led to _one_ goal\\nonly, and Montreal had a _two_ goal lead.  My main concern is the second \\ngoal.\\n\\n\\nWhat you say about the skaters is absolutely true.  But realize that the \\ngame was effectively *won*.  You could watch any hockey game (in fact, you\\ncould watch any sporting event period) and spend hours discussing the 'what\\nif's' w.r.t. missed opportunities.  They are not important when the final\\nresult is decided.  If I get the time soon, I'll watch the game again and\\nemail you a list of lucky Montreal bounces and a list of Quebec offensive\\nscrewups.  Montreal was _leading_ with a minute to go.  The goalie\\nis the last line of defence, and I will grant that extra attention is\\nfocussed on him, sometimes without justification.  But Roy gave up a *lousy*\\ngoal, and a team cannot afford such a goal.\\n\\n\\n\\nWHO CARES?  Of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally\\nunrelated lousy play?  I could do a Hextall critique if you'd like.  But if\\nyou're going to assess his performance, keep in mind that he made the key\\nsaves at the key times.\\n\\n\\nFor the record, I did not say that Roy was not one of the top goaltenders in\\nthe league.  In fact, I agree that he is.\\n\\n                            \\nI assume you are referring to me.  However, I have pointed out that I think\\nthe loss can be blamed on Roy.  I have not said he sucks, nor do I think I've\\nmade any other 'derogatory comments'.  If you regard objective\\n(and informed, FYI) observations as derogatory, I really can't help you. \\n\",\"Picture if you will, the Habs going into the last couple minutes of the\\ngame, leading 2-0.

Anybody who plays\\nthe way he does, does not belong in the NHL. There have been cheap shot artists\\nthrough the history of the game, but a lot of them have been talanted players.\\nBobby Clarke, Kenny Linsemen, Pie McKenzie, Chris Chelios etc.. but nobody has been\\nout right as dirty a cheapshot coward as Ulf. Violence in hockey has got to be curbed\\nand players like (Should have been a Women) Samuelson don't belong. When players\\nlike Ulf, who's main purpose is to injure the better players in the league is allowed\\nto continue, and the league won't stop it, the players should. A Christian Pro 1000\\naluminum stick directed at his ugly head should do the trick nicely. If the Bruins get\\na chance to meet Pittsburgh in the near future, you can bet Neely will have his day.\\nThe sight of watching Ulf turtle up like the coward he is, is worth almost as much as a\\nStanely Cup. This wimp of a player almost ruined the career of one the best right wingers\\nin the game. If you are to remove Ulf Samuelson from the lineup, the Penguins would not\\neven notice he's gone. He's an eyesore on the game of hockey.\\n\",\"\\nThat's not inner calm.  It's boredom, and it's being spoiled.  The Arena's\\nbeen as quiet as a church on many nights this year; too many of us just\\ntake winning for granted.  It's been seemingly forever since the team\\nlost, and we've forgotten what it's like to feel real excitement and\\nsurprise at victory.\\n\\nWhile I'm glad to have the Pens doing so well, in some ways it was a better\\nhigh back when the Pens beat the Bruins two years ago, and the Rangers last\\nyear.

So your wager should be\\namended to read that Sharks are likely to have their 5th GM before the\\nPanther's get their 2nd. Can't wait to see how the next season's NHL\\nGuide and Record Book lists the GM history of the Sharks.\\n\\nGiven the depth of next year's draft, the expansion draft rules, and\\nthe reputation of their GMs, Anaheim and Miami look pretty good as the\\nfirst 90s expansion teams to win a Cup.  San Jose and Ottawa have\\ninstability at the GM position, something that Philly, NYI, Edmonton,\\nand Calgary did not have when they won their first Cups. Pittsburgh\\ndid, but they needed a quarter century.\",\"\\n\\nActually, they're pretty worthless, if you want to evaluate players\\nwith stats.  RBIs and Runs Scored should be banned; all they do is\\nconfuse victims of mediot brainwashing like yourself.  \\n\\n  You\\n\\n\\nUh, so?\\n\\nYou've just explained why we use OBP and SLG to evaluate players.\\nPrecisely because the team that scores more runs wins the game.\\nTraditional baseball stats have gotten way too far away from methods\\nwhich enable fans to see who contributes to those runs scored - that's\\nwhere OBP, SLG, Runs Created, Linear Weights, etc. come in.  These\\nsimplify matters so that we can more easily measure a player's\\noffensive contribution to the team's runs scored.\\n\\nThank you for making our case.

Aside from the major chip\\nhe seemed to have on his shoulder, what was the problem.  Gant had a reason\\nto want some time (disputed strike call).  Gant hadn't been wasting time all\\ngame.  The game had been cruising along, and was just over two hours old.\\nThe score was 1-0, with 2 outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position.\\nIs there *any* reason Hirschbeck couldn't, and shouldn't, cut Gant a little\\nslack?  For no discernible constructive reason, Hirschbeck disrupted the\\ngame, caused a five minute delay, and materially hurt the batter in a key\\nsituation.

His\\n1988 season is pretty decent for a rookie 2B.  The move to\\nthird base explains a lot of his 1989.  When he returned as an OF,\\nhe began hitting again.  And of course, last year he slumped.\\n\\nBut no learning curve?  He has obviously improved his batting eye\\nover the years, as well as his SB\\u002fCS ratio.  As to his fielding,\\nhe was an infielder when he was drafted, a 2Bman as he came\\nup through the Braves system, and then the Braves put him through\\n2 position changes in the space of a year.  He's an adequate OF,\\nalthough not great, and at least some of your perception of his\\nfielding is colored by watching him learn to play the OF at the\\nML level.  (I know you're another long-term Braves fan :)\\n\\nAbout playing 3B...IMO, that's the 2nd most DIFFICULT position\\nto field, after catcher.  At SS or 2B, you need more range and \\nspeed, but at 3B, you've got to have quick reflexes and have \\na GUN for an arm.  There are NO second chances at 3B, even when\\nplaying sandlot softball!  Granted, I'd still put my best\\noverall infielder at SS, but that's because he gets more\\nchances, not because the job is harder.  It still amazes me\\nthat so many teams have tried to convert other position players\\nto 3B.  But maybe that's because the supply of \\\"natural\\\" 3B is\\nscarce.\\n\\nFinally, Gant is a player who puts pressure on himself to\\nperform well, and works hard to improve.  You don't get\\nthose amazingly huge arms on that relatively small body without a\\nlot of weight work.  Now, whether he's been overdoing it these\\ndays may be a valid question, as is the question of whether\\nhe tries too hard to make something happen during each at-bat.\\nBut frankly, if a player is going to not live up to potential,\\nI'd much rather they fail by trying too hard, than by not\\ntrying hard enough.  You might be able to teach relaxation\\nto an adult; but at that age I don't believe you can teach\\nhustle.\\n\\nAll that said, I don't think I'd sign Gant to another long-term\\ncontract.  He's 28 now, and I think he's free-agent eligible\\nin 2 years, when he'll be 30.  Given his career curve and\\nlimitations, I wouldn't expect him to last much past 35\\nas a ML ballplayer.  He might surprise me here, but Atlanta's\\ngot some talent on the farm, and I'd rather take my chances\\ndown the road with Nieves et al.\",\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it is subject to all kinds of bias, and is almost completely useless\\nfor first basemen.  From the raw stats, there is no way to tell which of\\na first baseman's putouts were made on throws from other fielders, and\\nwhich were made on his own plays; likewise, you can't tell whether a\\ndouble play was 6-4-3 or 3-6-3.  Fielding Runs thus gives a first\\nbaseman no credit for putouts or double plays, only for assists and\\nerrors.  \\n\\nIt thus favors first basemen who play deep, reaching a lot of balls but\\nforcing the pitcher to cover first more frequently.  It also hurts first\\nbaseman who play behind left-handed pitching staffs and thus face few\\nleft-handed batters.\\n\\n\\nThis is better; of course, it still isn't all of a first baseman's\\ndefense.\\n\\n\\nDefensive Average, which uses larger (and probably better) zones, has\\nMattingly tied for second in the league.\\n\\n\\nWhile 233 batting runs is good, it is mostly in the past; the runs he\\nproduced in 1986 don't say much about his value in 1993.  \\n\",\"[argument over \\\"reasonable\\\" players and umpires deleted]\\n\\n\\n\\nYes, but the baseball rules say you can only appeal a ball and not a\\nstrike.

It has been a while since he last rode (\\u003e10 years), and I myself\\nhave never bought a new bike from a dealer. What follows is an experience\\nof that visit and of an observation of \\\"SQUILDLY\\\" behavior by other \\ncustomers and\\u002for sales personel:\\n\\nBACKGROUND:\\n\\nI ride with a group of friends, who mainly are into \\\"cruiser\\\" type bikes. My\\nfriend was hell bent on getting an Intruder and had seen a few used ones. He\\nwanted to see what the new ones were going for, so we happened upon a dealer\\nthat sold both Suzuki and Yamaha. \\n\\nThe place was fairly busy, so we browsed a bit. We happened upon a few \\nIntruders, most of which had SOLD signs on. My friend had been bitten.\\n\\nWell the salesdroid appeared and as my friend started chewing the fat, I \\nmoseid on outside. The next thing I know, I see 3 or 4 sport bikes pull in.\\nI could stereo-type the type of riders (backward ball hat, oakley, IQ \\u003c40),\\nbut I won't. Well they went inside, I didn't think much of it. I figured\\nto each his own. I went back in to see if the salesdroid had his fangs\\nfirmly implanted into my friends back,  when I noticed the \\\"hormone gang\\\"\\ntalking to other salesdroids\\u002fmanagers. Lot's of laughter, jokes etc. No big\\ndeal.\\n\\nHere is the part that concerned me. The \\\"HG\\\" and those shop personel that were\\nnot busy with customers went back out, where said \\\"HG\\\" members fired up their\\nrides and did the obligatory reving up of those 600 beasts. At this point,\\none decided to see how much rubber  a Katana 600 could deposit in the drive.\\n\\nSQUIDS, I thought to myself. BUT I was appalled that the salesdroids\\u002fmanager\\nnot only condoned this behavior, but encourged it, to the point were they\\nwere betting how long he could keep it up and egged him on to pull a wheely\\nas he rode off onto a busy street around rush hour. THe girl that was riding pillion on another bike, seemed rather hormonal about this display, and urged her\\n\\\"pilot\\\" to quickly catch up. The others followed, making sure there Kerkers\\ncould be heard as well as felt.\\n\\nI felt embarassed at this point to be a motorcyclist. I felt the eyes of those\\nin cages, witnessing this display, then glancing over to the dealers lot and\\ndamning all those on two wheels. Needless to say, my friend felt a little\\nuncomfortable and we left. \\n\\nI will now turn off my frustration and go ride... peacefully, to clear my\\nanger. I only hope that the cop who is following me home, has an open\\nmind and doesn't associate me with them. \",\"********* 1990 Integra LS for Sale *********\\n\\n5 speed, sunroof, rear spoiler, new tires\\n59.7K miles\\n\\n$ 7950 or best offer.\\n\\ncall 908-949-0878\\n     908-938-4101\\n\\nemail att!hotsoup!peng\",\"OK,\\n\\n    I saw a bike today and I want to know what it is.  Lets begin\\nby saying that its whole rear end was definately Hawk 650.  Additionally,\\nit had a CBR900RR style tank, full fairing, and only a tach.  Now, at\\nfirst I thought it was an 'RC31' (a Hawk modified by Two Brothers Racing),\\nbut I did not think that they made this huge tank for it.  Additionally,\\nthe gauges were certainly not from a Hawk.  They looked much more like \\n900RR gauges.  Overall, the bike looked like a 900RR except for the\\nrear single-sided swingarm and wheel (there were straight from the Hawk)\\n\\nSo, what did I see?\\n\\n(PS, for any of you Boulder DoDers, I saw it parked at the Engineering\\ncenter today.

Books have been written on that! But in regard to\\nAeroStich it really depends on your particular size, shape and needs.\\nIf you upper and lower body are not proportional (according to aero\\ndimensions) then it probably is going to be better mixing and matching\\nthe 2 piece suit. I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it.\\nHaving my life quota of scars from crashing off road, I am very\\nconcerned with good protection and I believe that the difference in\\nprotection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible. I\\nthink the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a\\ndifference. One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you go\\nsomewhere and then want to walk around for a while (still with jacket)\\nyou can just detach and stow the pants. \\n\\nOne thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit for\\nmany women (with standard suits). Supposedly for smaller women (and\\npetite men for that matter) the 1 piece will fit better. \\n\\nAnother recommendation is to pay for mods if you need them. I wish I\\ngot 2-3 inches added to my pant legs. I find the Long suits are not\\nreally that long (I can't imagine how short the standard suits must\\nbe). \\n\",\"\\n\\nThis is vague, so I am posting it in case anyone else knows more.\\n\\nI recall reading of a phonograph which used mechanical amplification.\\nCompressed air was squirted out of a valve which was controlled by the\\npickup.

Hence, at a light, reving makes it twist.  Shaft effect is the\\nrear end rising under power or (the real problem) getting lower to the road\\nwhen the throttle is snapped shut (say when you are cornering and the heads\\nare real close to the road).  New GS bikes with the paralever shaft have\\nalmost no shaft effect.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's a question of how long you spend at low RPM and how much you need the\\nextra light.  At low RPM, 3K and under, they don't charge all that much if\\nat all.  The alternators put out sufficient wattage, it just that you need\\nto be at 4K RPM to get it.  \\n\\n\\nFull choke.  Open the gas taps.  Hit the starter and ever so slightly blip the\\nthrottle.  It should fire.  Cranking should be done with minimal throttle.\\nMy R100 likes the throttles to be raised just a bit off idle.\\n\\nIt's an EXPERIENCE thing.  Like Zen, it's hard to describe.  It can be hard\\nto learn if you aren't paying atttention to the differences between success\\nand failure.  Especially if you get really pissed off and flatten the\\nbattery while trying to get it to run.\\n\\nIf my bike has been sitting for a few weeks, I give it a short while to\\nstart.  If it doesn't, I turn it off and wait a few minutes for things to\\nvaporize in the fuel system and then it lights right off.  I've got dual\\nplugs which make it easier to start.\\n\\n\\nThe BIG fix is the Bing carb upgrade kit.  It's good for a few MPG and the\\nparts are alcohol proof.  The parts it replaces aren't alcohol proof.  As\\nlong as the bike isn't going to sit for long periods of time, gasohol is\\nnice since it helps keep ping away.

The only other things \\nwhich come to mind, since this is a gravity feed fuel system, is this.\\nThe fuel petcock valve is vacuum controlled from the #1 carburator. Let\\nsuppose there is a small hole or bad seal either in the hose itself or the\\nvacuum valve in the fuel petcock. When it is cold, the hole is open enough\\nto open the valve just enough to allow gas to the carbs with the choke on, \\nsince the choke creates more low pressure in the carbs when on to draw gas, \\nand as the engine and surrounding area warm up, the hole seals up. \\n\\nOne way to check fuel flow through the valve would be to pull the side \\npanels off and remove the fuel hose to the carbs. Connect a tube of the \\ncorrect size, preferably clear tubing to observe fuel flow, on the output\\nside of the fuel petcock. Remove the control hose from #1 carburator. Make\\nsure the tank is full. Place the valve in the ON position and apply vacuum \\nto the control hose, preferably with a vacuum device with a gauge, to check \\nfor air leaks. With vacuum applied, fuel should flow freely. To see if there is\\na vent problem, do this with the fuel filler cap open and closed, if it \\nflows a lot faster with the filler cap open, then there may be something in \\nthe vent airway which changes position and depending on the position may clog \\nor partially clog the vent. I have heard of some F2 fuel tanks being replaced \\nto fix this problem. So the things which might be defective are, the control\\nhose from #1 carb, the petcock valve, and possibly the fuel tank vent.\\n\\nNow if all of the above shows no problem of fuel flow when cold, then there \\nis something in the carbs screwed up, but there are so many things to check, \\nI would be typing all day to list them all! \\n\\nHere are a few, with everything back together, apply vacuum to the petcock valve\\nand open the drain holes on the carbs one by one to check fuel flow. Open up the\\nairbox and check for foreign debris or clogged airways on the carbs, there are\\nquite a few on each carb.\\n\\nI hope something is flushed out with all this trouble shooting.

Is there really a big difference?\\n\\nIt has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a\\nsensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn't paying real close attention I\\nmight push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which\\nwould wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned \\nthe thing off.  I'm pretty coordinated, so this doesn't bother me, if it\\nwere for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I'm ok with it.\\n\\nThe installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal\\nand a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal\\nfrom the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I'm\\nnot sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what\\nexactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get\\nit?\\n\\nI think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative\\nside tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and\\nall that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:\\n\\n\\t1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a\\n\\t    device?\\n\\t2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?\\n\\t3.  Are \\\"professionally\\\" installed CCs signifacantly better and\\n\\t    worth the cabbage?\\n\\t4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just\\n\\t    that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple \\n\\t    needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically,\\n\\t    the questions above)?\\n\\nMy father and I built a \\\"Veep\\\" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in\\nhigh school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and\\ncars.

Thiokol provided me with samples and data on\\na reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solid\\nmotor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of \\naluminum in the mix.  For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percent\\nAluminum.  The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure.\\nThe structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspect\\nsome bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you made\\na bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what\\nyou get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in\\nall directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into\\nthe voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  The\\nfoamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant,\\nso there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The major\\nimprovement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is the\\nprincipal failure mode for solid propellant.\\n\\nDani Eder\\n\",\"The Bricklin was a car manufactured by a company started by Malcolm\\nBricklin, who, I believe, was Canadian.

Apparently the problem is not that common, but I'd be curious\\nif anyone else out there has a similar problem, perhaps to see if a cause can be\\nfound. \",\"\\nI don't like the term \\\"quack\\\" being applied to a licensed physician David.\\nQuestionable conduct is more appropriately called unethical(in my opinion).\\nI'll give you some examples.\\n\\n\\t1. Prescribing controlled substances to patients with no \\n\\t   demonstrated need(other than a drug addition) for the medication.\\n\\n\\t2. Prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid \\n\\t   function for the purpose of quick weight loss.\\n\\n\\t3. Using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has \\n\\t   been shown to be ineffective and dangerous(cyanide release) by \\n\\t   the NCI.\\n\\nThese are errors of commission that competently trained physicians should \\nnot committ but sometimes do.  There are also errors of omission(some of \\nwhich result in malpractice suits).  I don't think that using anti-fungal \\nagents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be \\nhaving a problem with candida(or another fungal growth) is an error of \\ncommission or omission.  Healers have had a long history of trying to \\nrelieve human suffering.  Some have stuck to standard, approved procedures,\\nothers have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is a \\nchance that it will help the patient.  The key has to be tied to the \\nhealer's oath, \\\"I will do no harm\\\".  But you know David that very few \\ntreatments involve no risk to the patient.  The job of the physician is a \\nvery difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed.  Each \\nphysician deals with this risk\\u002fbenefit paradox a little differently.  Some \\nare very conservative while others are more agressive.  An agressive \\napproach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as long \\nas the motive is improving the patient's health and not an attempt to rake \\nin lots of money(through some of the schemes that have been uncovered in \\nthe medicare fraud cases), I don't see the need to label these healers as \\nquacks or even unethical.\\n\\nWhat do I reserve the term quack for?  Pseudo-medical professionals.  \\nThese people lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for the \\nfrustrated patient to fall into their lair.  Some of these individuals are \\nreally doing a pretty good job of providing \\\"alternative\\\" medicine.  But \\nmany lack any formal training and are in the \\\"business\\\" simply to make a \\nfew fast bucks.   While a patient can be reasonably assured of getting \\ncompetent care when a liscenced physician is consulted, this alternative \\ncare area is really a buyer's beware arena.  If you are lucky, you may find \\nsomeone who can help you.  If you are unlucky, you can loose a lot of \\nmoney and develop severe disease because of the inability of these pseudo-\\nmedical professional to diagnose disease(which is the fortay of the \\nliscened physicians).\\n\\nI hope that this clears things up David.\",\"Okay, this is a long shot.\\n\\nMy friend Robin has recurring bouts of mononucleosis-type symptoms, very  \\nregularly.  This has been going on for a number of years.  She's seen a  \\nnumber of doctors; six was the last count, I think.  Most of them have  \\nsaid either \\\"You have mono\\\" or \\\"You're full of it; there's nothing wrong  \\nwith you.\\\"  One has admitted to having no idea what was wrong with her,  \\nand one has claimed that it is Epstein-Barr syndrome.\\n\\nNow, what she told me about EBS is that very few doctors even believe that  \\nit exists.  (Obviously, this has been her experience.)  So, what's the  \\nstory?  Is it real?  Does the medical profession believe it to be real?\\n\\nHas anyone had success is treating EBS?  Or is it just something to live  \\nwith?  Thanks for your assistance.\",\"\\nEver heard of something called the placebo effect? I think Dyer is\\nreacting because it looks to be yet another case of the same old\\nquackery over and over again.\\n\\nIt true that current medical knowledge is limited, but do you realize\\njust HOW MANY quacks exist eager to suck your $$$$. It's playing the\\nlottery at best.\\n\\nIf the results you got were so clear and obvious, would you mind\\ntrying a little experiment to see if it is true? It would be quite\\nsimple. Have sugar pills and have real pills.  Take one set for one\\nweek and the other set for another week without knowing which ones are\\nthe real pills. Then at the end of the 2 weeks compare the results.\\nLet's say you're wife would know which are the real ones. If what you\\nare experiencing is true there should be a marked difference between\\neach week. \\n \\njohn\\n\",\"\\n: As you know all ready, it is the pattern in the bioplasmic energy\\n: field that is significant.\\n\\nNo, I didn't already know that.

Anyway, as Ross Perot said, I'm all ears.  Well, eyes in\\nthis case.\\n\",\"I've read that exercise makes the heart pump more blood at a stroke, and\\nthat it also makes the heart pumb slower, in order to make up for the\\ngreater volume. My Internist, who diagnosed my AV block, slow heart rate\\nand PVC's, told me something different. She says that heart rate is\\nassociated with the electrical properties of the hear muscle, not its\\nsize. Exercise lowers heart rate and increases stroke volume, but the\\neffects are unrelated except for their common source. The AV block, she\\nasserts, is another electrical effect, which is irreversable - even when\\nexercise is dicontinued. PVC's are also common in runners. \\n\\nSo my EKG puts me in a class with trained athletes and also with heart\\npatients. Isn't that strange, though? Are there any not-so-beneficial\\naspects to athlete's heart?

It is what you feel if you are overwhelmed by a feeling\\nof comfort, such as seeing or thinking about something beautiful.\\n\\n     Another thing.  When you sleep, you lie down facing up, with your\\npalms aside of you and facing down on the surface of the bed.  Then you\\nrelax, and there start involuntary nerve firings inside your flesh.  So,\\nyou feel a \\\"shiver\\\" below the surface of the skin (not heart-beat).\\nThen this shiver increases, and comes up to your head, and the roam you\\nhear loudens.

This\\nroam is different from the high pitch, but follows the shiver of your\\nbody.\\n\\n     \\\"Shiver\\\" is not the word.

The researchers contacted \\n2,317 former patients on whom an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon performed \\ninvasive  procedures between January 1, 1978 and June 30, 1992.  The  \\northopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after  testing positive \\nfor HIV.  A total of 1,174 former patients  underwent HIV testing, \\nrepresenting 50.7 percent of patients on  whom the orthopedic surgeon \\nperformed invasive procedures during  the 13.5-year period.  Patients were \\ntested from each year and  from each category of invasive procedure.  All \\npatients were  found to be negative for HIV by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent  \\nassay.  Two former patients reported known HIV infection prior to surgery.  \\nThe examination of AIDS case registries and vital  records neglected to detect \\ncases of HIV infection among former  surgical patients.  The estimated cost of \\nthe initial patient  notification and testing was $158,000, with the single \\nmost  expensive activity being counseling and testing.  This accounted  for 37 \\npercent of the total expense.  The patient notification  and testing were \\nconducted while maintaining the confidentiality  of the orthopedic surgeon who \\nwas an active participant in the  planning and execution of the study.  \\nNotifying patients of the  infected surgeon's HIV-status is both disruptive \\nand expensive  and is not routinely recommended, the researchers conclude. \\\\ \\n       =================================================================     \\n\\\"Investigation of Potential HIV Transmission to the Patients of  an HIV-\\nInfected Surgeon\\\" Journal of the American Medical Association (04\\u002f14\\u002f93) Vol. \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 38\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n269,  No. 14, P. 1795  (Smith Rogers, Audrey et al.) \\n\\n     The risk of HIV transmission during surgery is so remote that it  will be \\nquantified only by gathering data from multiple,  methodologically similar \\ninvestigations, writes Audrey Smith  Rogers et al. of the Johns Hopkins \\nUniversity School of Medicine  in Baltimore, Md.  The researchers identified a \\ntotal of 1,131  persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical  \\nprocedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the HIV-positive  surgeon was \\nlisted as the operating surgeon.  The AIDS case  registries were reviewed for \\nall patients having undergone  invasive procedures and death certificates were \\nobtained.  Among  the 1,131 patients, 101 were dead, 119 had no address, 413 \\nhad  test results known, and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire. No \\nstudy patient name was found in reported AIDS case registries. One newly \\ndetected, HIV-positive patient was determined to have  been most probably \\ninfected in 1985 during a transfusion.  There  was no HIV transmission in 369 \\nperson-hours of surgical exposure, suggesting that HIV transmission to \\npatients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person-hours \\nof surgical  exposure.  The researchers determined there is no evidence to  \\nsuggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard  infection-control \\nguidelines; over 50 percent of the patients  with invasive procedures chose to \\nbe tested, and of those whose  results were revealed, only one person was \\nfound to be infected  with HIV.  The study patient's infection was probably \\nthe result  of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985.  As a result,  \\nthere is no evidence that the transmission of HIV from the  HIV-positive \\nsurgeon to any patient transpired, the researchers  conclude. \\n      ==================================================================\\n                                April 20, 1993 \\n      ==================================================================\\n \\\"Drug Concerns to Share AIDS Data\\\" New York Times (04\\u002f20\\u002f93), P. C10  \\n(Kolata, Gina) \\n\\n     A total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided, in a  highly \\nunusual move, to share AIDS drugs and information while  the drugs are \\nundergoing early clinical testing.  Dr. Edward  Scolnick, president of the \\nMerck Research Laboratory in Rahway,  N.J., arranged the collaboration.  He \\nsaid that cooperation  between companies seemed increasingly significant as it \\nhad  become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more  effective \\nin fighting HIV than any drug used alone.  The  researchers are hopeful that \\nHIV, when faced with a combination  of several drugs requiring mutation at \\ndifferent sites for  resistance to develop, will be unable to evolve all the \\nmutations at the same time.  Therefore, several drugs taken together or one \\nafter the other could halt the spread of HIV.  Currently, the  drug companies \\ndo not know what other drugs their competitors are developing.  The new \\nagreement allows companies to routinely  exchange animal data and safety data \\non new AIDS drugs.  \\\"An  agreement like this will greatly facilitate \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 39\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\ncompanies' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a \\nmuch more  efficient way,\\\" said Scolnick.  He also said that the  \\ncollaboration would not violate antitrust laws.  In creating the  agreement, \\nMerck spoke frequently to members of AIDS advocacy  groups, including ACT-UP.  \\nDr. Daniel Hoth, director of the  division on AIDS at the National Institute \\nof Allergy and  Infectious Disease said, \\\"We're delighted to see the  \\npharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that  increasing the \\ninformation flow will likely accelerate the  discovery of better compounds for \\nAIDS.\\\"  Related Stories: Wall Street Journal (04\\u002f20) P.

However, a report in the Lancet demonstrated that AZT should \\nnot be used early in the course of disease.  While the CD4 counts of the 877 \\npeople given AZT were consistently greater  than those of patients receiving \\nonly placebo, the first three  years of follow-up have shown that the \\nproportions of people in  the two groups progressing to overt AIDS or even to \\ndeath were  not significantly different at roughly 18 percent.  The  \\nconclusions are that AZT is not an effective AIDS drug in  HIV-infected \\nindividuals, and that CD4 cell count may not be a  reliable proxy for the \\nprogression to AIDS in infected people.   But nothing is implied by the study \\nof the utility of AZT in the  treatment of those in whom symptoms have already \\nappeared--there  is no case for abandoning that treatment, at least on the  \\nevidence now available.  It is much more alarming that the CD4  count has \\nproven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in HIV \\ninfection.  AIDS researchers should acknowledge  HIV is alive from the \\nbeginning of infection and turn it into a  workable assay of the progress of \\ndisease.  The general  application of such an assay will probably in itself \\nprovide a  better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS, concludes  \\nMaddox. \\n      ================================================================== \\n\\\"Infective and Anti-Infective Properties of Breastmilk From  HIV-1-Infected \\nWomen\\\" Lancet (04\\u002f10\\u002f93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 914   (Van de Perre, Philippe \\net al.) \\n\\n     A vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of  the IgM \\ntype in the mother's body fluids could be valuable to  prevent transmission of \\nHIV-1 from mother to child, write  Philippe Van de Perre et al. of the \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 40\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nNational AIDS Control Program in Kigali, Rwanda.  The researchers hypothesized \\nthat  transmission of HIV-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the  \\npresence of infected cells, by deficiency of anti-infective  substances in \\nbreastmilk, or both factors.  A total of 215  HIV-1-infected women were \\nenrolled at delivery in Kigali, Rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days, 6 \\nmonths, and 18 months post partum.  HIV-1 IgG, secretory IgA, and IgM were \\nassayed by  western blot, for the latter two after removal of IgG with  \\nprotein G.  In the 15-day and 6-month samples, the researchers  sought viral \\ngenome in milk cells by double polymerase chain  reaction with three sets of \\nprimers (gag, pol, and env).  At 15  days, 6 months, and 18 months post \\npartum, HIV-1 specific IgG was detected in 95 percent, 98 percent, and 97 \\npercent of breastmilk  samples; IgA in 23 percent, 28 percent, and 41 percent; \\nand IgM  in 66 percent, 78 percent, and 41 percent.  In children who  survived \\nlonger than 18 months the risk of infection was  associated with lack of \\npersistence of IgM and IgA in their  mothers' milk.  The presence of HIV-1-\\ninfected cells in the milk  15 days post partum was strongly predictive of \\nHIV-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis.  \\nThe  combination of HIV-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgM \\nresponse was the strongest predictor of infection.  IgM and  IgA anti-HIV-1 in \\nbreastmilk may protect against postnatal  transmission of HIV, the researchers \\nconclude. \\n      ==================================================================    \\n                                April 21, 1993 \\n      ==================================================================    \\n\\\"Firms to Share AIDS Research in Global Venture\\\" Journal of Commerce \\n(04\\u002f21\\u002f93), P. 7A \\n\\n     A total of fifteen U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies  announced \\nTuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage AIDS \\nresearch to hasten the search for combination  therapies to fight HIV \\ninfection and AIDS.

Does anone have any information\\n\\nI'm not sure that this condition is \\\"recognised\\\" anywhere (in the\\nsense of a disease with diagnostic criteria, clear boundaries\\nbetween it and other diseases, unique pathologic or physiologic\\nfeatures, etc), but here goes with what many neurologists agree on.\\n\\nPost-polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron disease\\nby clinical examination, EMG, and muscle biopsy.  The abnormalities\\nare mostly chronic (due to old polio) but there is evidence of\\nongoing deterioration.  Clinically, the patients complain of\\ndeclining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks.\\nMusculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtless\\ncontributes to the impaired performance.  The examination shows\\nmuscle weakness and atrophy.  The EMG shows evidence of old\\ndenervation with reinnervation (giant and long-duration motor unit\\naction potentials) *and* evidence of active denervation\\n(fibrillation potentials).  The biopsy also shows old denervation\\nwith reinnervation (fiber-type grouping) *and* evidence of active\\ndenervation (small, angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzyme\\nstaining) - but curiously, little or no group atrophy.\\n\\nPost-polio patients do not have ALS.  In ALS, there is clinically\\nevident deterioration from one month to the next.  In post-polio,\\nthe patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from one\\nyear to the next.  Of course, there are patients who had polio\\nbefore who develop genuine ALS, but ALS is no more common among\\npolio survivors than among people who never had polio.\\n\\nThe cause of post-polio syndrome is unknown.  There is little\\nevidence that post-polio patients have active polio virus or\\ndestructive immunologic response to virus antigen.\\n\\nThere is no solid evidence that patients with post-polio have\\nanything different happening to the motor unit (anterior horn cells,\\nmotor axons, neuromuscular junctions, and muscle fibers) than\\npatients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration.\\nBoth groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings.  The reason\\nfor these \\\"acute\\\" changes in a \\\"chronic\\\" disease (old polio) is\\nunknown.  Possibly spinal motor neurons (that have reinnervated huge\\nnumbers of muscle fibers) start shedding the load after several\\nyears.\\n\\nThere are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post-polio\\nsyndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny\\ndeterioration.  The PPS patients are more likely to have had severe\\npolio.  The PPS patients are *much* more likely to complain of pain.\\nThey also tend to score higher on depression scales of\\nneuropsychologic tests.\\n\\nMy take on this (I'm sure some will disagree):  after recovery from\\nsevere polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles, tendons,\\nligaments, bones, and joints, that leads to inflammatory and\\u002for\\ndegenerative conditions affecting these structures.  The increasing\\npain, superimposed on the chronic (but unchanging) weakness, leads\\nto progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL.  I am\\nperhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPS\\npatient who was not limited in some way by pain.  I do not believe\\nthat PPS patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than\\nnon-PPS patients (i.e., those with old polio of similar severity but\\nwithout PPS complaints).\",\"\\n\\n  Too many MDs on the list and not enough RNs in my opinion.\\n\\n  Doug\\n\",\"A friend of mine has been diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis, as a result of\\ntrauma sustained in a car accident several years ago.

The main legal principles of the Turkish State \\nare summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution:\\n\\n\\t\\\"The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social State\\n\\tgoverned by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public\\n\\tpeace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights;\\n\\tloyal to the nationalism of Ataturk, and based on the fundamental\\n\\ttenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution.\\\"\\n\\nFreedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire, allowing\\nthe many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. The\\nfact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be\\nattributed to these freedoms, despite the lack of any written Constitution.\\nThe first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856.\\nAlthough the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force\\nonly temporarily, they provided the basic elements of a Constitution.\\n\\nThe 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and\\nthe right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor. The Constitution\\nof 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor, while increasing\\nthe power of the Parliament and the government.\\n\\nThe First World War (1914-1918) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end. By the\\noccupation of Istanbul, the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was\\nabolished. The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the\\noccupying forces.\\n\\nDuring the Independence War, the \\\"Turkish Grand National Assembly\\\" held their\\nfirst meeting on April 23, 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new\\nTurkish state. This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish\\nRepublic. The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29, 1923 and the new\\nConstitution was adopted in 1924. That Constitution served as the legal \\nbackbone of today's modern Turkish Republic. In 1945, Turkey adopted a \\nmulti-party political system. The Constitution of 1924 was replaced by\\nothers in 1961 and 1982. All three Constitutions of the Republic have been\\nbased on the principles of parliamentary democracy, human rights, national\\nsovereignty, division of powers, private ownership and secularization.\\n\\n\\\"Major Principles of the Constitution\\\"\\n\\nThe constitution (with 177 Articles) establishes the structure of the Republic\\nwithin the following principles:\\n\\n- The Turkish Republic is a democratic, secular and social state governed by \\n  law;\\n- It should be governed to maintain public peace, national solidarity, justice,\\n  human rights and the objectives of Ataturk;\\n- The language of the State is Turkish;\\n- Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions.\\n  Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation;\\n- Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation. This\\n  power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else;\\n- Executive power is exercised by the President, and Council of Ministers;\\n- Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the\\n  Turkish nation;\\n- All individuals are equal, irrespective of language, race, religion, color,\\n  sex, or political beliefs;\\n- Laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution.\\n\\n\\\"Structure of the State\\\"\\n\\nIn accordance with the Constitution, the structure of the state is based on the\\nprinciple of \\\"division of power\\\" to create a balanced and self-controlled\\nsystem. The power is divided into \\\"legislative power,\\\" \\\"executive power,\\\" and\\n\\\"judicial power,\\\" balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each\\nother (self-control).\\n\\n A. Legislative Power:\\n\\n The \\\"Turkish Grand National Assembly\\\" is a parliament with one House, elected\\n by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on\\n behalf of the nation. The basic functions of this Assembly are:\\n\\n - to adopt, to amend, or to repeal laws;\\n - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers;\\n - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers;\\n - to debate, to amend and to approve annual budgets;\\n - to ratify international agreements;\\n - to grant amnesty or pardons.\\n\\n Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral\\n or written) during the course of their legislative duties. The country is\\n divided into constituencies. The number of representatives of each is\\n calculated according to its population. Every Turkish citizen over the age\\n of twenty-one can vote.\\n\\n Elections are supervised by the \\\"Supreme Council of Elections,\\\" which solves\\n all disputes or appeals. In each province, the local \\\"Board of Election\\\"\\n runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the\\n Supreme Council. Members of the Council and Boards are elected among \\n independent judges.\\n\\n B. Executive Power:\\n\\n The President of the Republic is the Head of State (not the head of government\\n as in the Unites States). The main functions of the President are:\\n\\n - to represent the State and the Country;\\n - to insure the implementation of the Constitution;\\n - to coordinate legislative, judicial and executive functions;\\n - act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces;\\n - to ratify laws and government decrees.\\n \\n The President is elected by the Grand National Assembly for a period of seven\\n years. The President may ratify or return the laws for a second debate, may \\n call for a referendum.\\n\\n Executive power is exercised by the \\\"Council of Ministers,\\\" headed by the\\n Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President from the\\n members of Parliament. The Prime Minister names the Ministers for approval\\n by the President. The new Government (Council of Ministers) reads their\\n program at the Parliament and the vote of confidence follows. There are 21 (?)\\n Ministers in the Council.\\n\\n Ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent\\n \\\"administrative\\\" courts for their misuse of power, administrative errors or\\n functions against any law.\\n\\n C. Judicial Power:\\n\\n Judicial power is exercised by independent courts. No authority or power can\\n instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts. These cannot be \\n discharged, replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the\\n reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws. There are three categories\\n of courts in the Turkish judiciary system:\\n\\n - Courts of justice deal with legal, commercial and criminal cases. The \\n   decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice\\n   upon the appeal of the parties involved.\\n - The decisions or functions of the executive power (including the Prime\\n   Minister and Ministers or any governmental department) can be appealed in\\n   administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law.\\n   The decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the\\n   high administrative court.\\n\\n The laws and decisions of the Grand National Assembly can be examined by the\\n \\\"Constitutional Court\\\" if they contradict the Constitution. If found\\n contradictory, this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the Parliament.\\n\\n\\nSerdar Argic\",\"From: Center for Policy Research \\u003ccpr\\u003e\\nSubject: Desertification of the Negev\\n\\n\\nThe desertification of the arid Negev\\n------------------------------------- by Moise Saltiel, I&P March\\n1990\\n\\nI.

The Negev as a\\nMilitary Base XIV.  The Negev in the Year 2000\\n\\nJust after the creation of the State of Israel, the phrase \\\"the\\nJewish pioneers will make the desert bloom\\\" was trumpeted\\nthroughout the Western world. After the Six Day War in 1967, David\\nBen-Gurion declared in a letter to Charles de Gaulle: \\\"It's by our\\npioneering creation that we have transformed a poor and arid land\\ninto a fertile land, created built-up areas, towns and villages in\\nabandoned desert areas\\\".\\n\\nContrary to Ben-Gurion's assertion, it must be affirmed that\\nduring the 26 years of the British mandate over Palestine and for\\ncenturies previous, a productive human presence was to be found in\\nall parts of the Negev desert - in the very arid hills and valleys\\nof the southern Negev as well as in the more fertile north. These\\nwere the Bedouin Arabs.\\n\\nThe real desertification of the Negev, mainly in the southern\\npart, occurred after Israel's dispossession of the Bedouin's\\ncultivated lands and pastures. Nowadays, the majority of the\\n12,800 square-kilometer Negev, which represents 62 percent of the\\nState of Israel (pre-1967 borders), has been desertified beyond\\nrecognition. The main new occupiers of the formerly Bedouin Negev\\nare the Israeli army; the Nature Reserves Authority, whose chief\\nrole is to prevent Bedouin from roaming their former pasture\\nlands; and vast industrial zones, including nuclear reactors and\\ndumping grounds for chemical, nuclear and other wastes. Israeli\\nJews in the Negev today cultivate less than half the surface area\\ncultivated by the Bedouin before 1948, and there is no Jewish\\npastoral activity.\\n\\nI. Agricultural and pastoral activities of the Negev Bedouin\\nbefore and after 1948\\n-------------------------------------------------- In 1942,\\naccording to British mandatory statistics, the Beersheba\\nsub-district (which corresponds more or less to Israel's Negev, or\\nSouthern, district) had 52,000 inhabitants, almost all Bedouin\\nArabs, who held 11,500 camels, 6,000 cows and oxen, 42,000 sheep\\nand 22,000 goats.\\n\\nThe majority of the Bedouin lived a more or less sedentary life in\\nthe north, where precipitation ranged between 200 and 350 mm per\\nyear. In 1944 they cultivated about 200,000 hectares of the\\nBeersheba district - i.e. 16 percent of its total area and *more\\nthan double the area cultivated by the Negev's Jewish settlers\\nafter 40 years of \\\"making the desert bloom\\\"*\\n\\nThe Bedouin had a very low crop yield - 350 to 400 kilograms of\\nbarley per hectare during rainy years - and their farming\\ntechniques were primitive, but production was based solely on\\nanimal and human labor. It must also be underscored that animal\\nproduction, although low, was based entirely on pasturing.\\nProduction increased considerably during the rainy years and\\ndiminished significantly during drought years. All Bedouin pasture\\nanimals - goats, camels and sheep - had the ability to gain weight\\nquickly over the relatively rainy winters and to withstand many\\nwaterless days during the hot summers. These animals were the\\nresult of a centuries-old process of natural selection in harsh\\nlocal conditions.\\n\\nAfter the creation of the State of Israel, 80 percent of the Negev\\nBedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan. The\\n10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of\\n40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150\\nmm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out\\nof three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev,\\nspring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin\\nshepherds from roaming.\\n\\nA few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev.\\nBut after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these\\nBedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure\\nwas applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields\\nin order that the land could be transferred to the army.\\n\\nNo reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held\\ntoday by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of\\nthe 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized\\nby the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now\\nconfined to seven \\\"development towns\\\", or *sowetos*, established\\nfor them.\",\"\\u003cYZKCU@CUNYVM.BITNET\\u003e\\n\\nIndeed Yaqouv, just like the ugly hatred spread by Kahane and\\nKahanists, right?

This impressive change in the province's ethnic character \\n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \\n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \\n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\\\" \\n (See also Map 1.

Why did not anyone venture to answer Andi's\\nquestion in an intelligent and unoffending manner?  The only\\nones guilty here of not backing up there viewpoints with fact\\nare the Israelophiles.  Now will we please start having some\\nINTELLIGENT conversation?  You all are an insult to you race!\\n{assuming you are also semitic}\\n\\tNow I have a comment concerning Israeli terrorism\\nduring the 1930's and 1940's.  The Hirgun, and other branch -\\noff militant groups, did fight the British do get them out of\\nPalestine.  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of\\nterrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the\\nArabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British\\nsoldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in\\nfavor of a compromise with the Palestinians.  In addition, they\\nmassacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing\\nto the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their\\nvery lives.\\n\\tI mention this not because I'm anti semitic [I'm part\\nJewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the\\nIsraelites pisses me off so.  I'm not as critical of the\\nPalestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the\\nJews.  It 's a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay for\\nGerman and European anti semitism.\",\"\\nAlberto, you've repeatedly misunderstood my postings.  You are now making the exact point\\nthat I've made several times but with a different definition of religion.  You don't not\\nhave to believe in the \\\"religious\\\" aspects of Judaism to be a Jew (this would confine\\nJudaism to be just a religion in the sense of a Christianity.).  So, by converting out of\\nJudaism, I don't mean just not believing in the god of Judaism.  I mean voluntarily\\nremoving yourself from the Jewish nation.  I am an agnostic but still consider myself\\nJewish because of my cultural heritage.  (I admit that many religious jews would argue\\nthat I am not completely jewish because of my lack of faith, but Judaism is a religion of\\ndissent and debate isn't it?).  The fact that one can opt to become Jewish simply by\\nconverting to Judaism makes the nation of the jewish people the *least* racist and most\\nopen nation.  We have no quotas!\\n\\nSo I will once again make my point.  Defining a member of the Jewish nation by religion\\n(not, as you say, religious belief) is NOT racism.  You come to your incorrect conclusion\\nbecause you use a different definition for religion when you define the law of return and\\nwhen you define judaism.\",\"\\nI think the problem here is that I pretty much ignored the part\\nabout the Jews sightseeing for 2000 years, thinking instead that\\nthe important part of what the original poster said was the bit\\nabout killing Palestinians.  In retrospect, I can see how the\\nsightseeing thing would be offensive to many.  I originally saw\\nit just as poetic license, but it's understandable that others\\nmight see it differently.  I still think that Ken came on a bit\\nstrong though.  I also think that your advice to Masud Khan:\\n\\n  #Before you argue with someone like Mr Arromdee, it's a good idea to\\n  #do a little homework, or at least think.\\n\\nwas unnecessary.\\n\\n\\nThroughout all your articles in this thread there is the tacit\\nassumption that the original poster was exhibiting casual\\nanti-semitism.  If I agreed with that, then maybe your speech\\non why this is bad might have been relevant.  But I think you're\\nreading a lot into one flip sentence.  While probably not\\ntrue in this case, too often the charge of anti-semitism gets\\nthrown around in order to stifle legitimate criticism of the\\nstate of Israel.\\n\\nAnyway, I'd rather be somewhere else, so I'm outta this thread.\",\"\\n\\nTsiel,\\n\\nI would contend that there was shelling from both sides of the border,\\nstarting from the early 70's.  Certainly the PLO did shell Northern\\nIsrael from the Arqoub region, but Israel did much more shelling\\ndestroying several South Lebanese villages.  At the very least\\nwe can say that both sides exchanged shelling, with occasional\\naerial raids by Israel on Lebanese villages.\\nIn any case Steve's characterization that the 1982 invasion was only in \\nresponse to years of shelling from Lebanon is false.  Israel had\\nmany reasons for invading but mainly it did so to install a government\\nin Lebanon favorable to Israel, and it nearly achieved this aim\\nwith the election of Basheer El Gemayel, and his brother, Amin\\nEl Gemayel, but the internal situation in Lebanon was too hard\\nto control and predict so Israel had to withdraw, and Amin El Gemayel\\nhad to abrogate the 17 th of May Agreement.\\n\",\"\\nBased on the same reasons?  You mean you were opposed to US intervention in\\nSomalia because since Somalia is a European country instead of the third world,\\nthe desire to help Somalia is racist?  I don't think this \\\"same reason\\\" applies\\nto Somalia at all.\\n\\nThe whole point is that Somalia _is_ a third world country, and we were more\\nwilling to send troops there than to Bosnia--exactly the _opposite_ of what\\nthe \\\"fixation on European countries\\\" theory would predict.  (Similarly, the\\ndesire to help Muslims being fought by Christians is also exactly the opposite\\nof what that theory predicts.)\\n\\n\\nI'm referring to people who want to help at all, of course.  You don't see\\npeople sending out press releases \\\"help Bosnian Serbs with ethnic cleansing!\\nThe Muslim presence in the Balkans should be eliminated now!\\\"  (Well, except\\nfor some Serbs, but I admit that the desire of Serbs in America to help the\\nSerbian side probably _is_ because those are people more like them.)\\n--\\n\\\"On the first day after Christmas my truelove served to me...

The first case would happen \\n  if no western intervention happened, and the second case was a direct \\n  or indirect result of western envolvement. \\n\\nPossibly, if 200,000 Iraqis had indeed died, but this number is based on\\nGreenpeace estimates.  Greenpeace had compromised its alleged\\nimpartiality during the war by condemning the potential environmental\\nconsequences of Allied miiltary action, while initially *completely*\\nignoring Iraq's horrible environmental crimes, starting with the dumping\\nof millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf at Ahmadi to the blowing of\\nover 700 oil wells.  What is the real number?  There has been a lot of\\nwork on this in the last two years, none of it reported as the\\nGreenpeace figure seems to get continuously bandied about.  The real\\nnumber seems to be around 10,000, on the same order as the number of\\nKuwaitis killed, tortured and kidnapped during the occupation.  I've\\nincluded an article I recently posted below, but this is really old\\nnews.  Independent Television News reported a figure around 15,000 only\\na few months after the war, but it was hardly reported. \\n\\nFor the Allies to have killed 200,000 Iraqis, they would have had to\\nkill twice the *total* number of Iraqis in Kuwait. \\n\\nThe favored image of the hysterics is the last battle of the war at\\nMutla'.  This was yet another example of the American and European media\\nplaying into the hands of Iraq and its de facto allies.     The\\ndestruction of the Iraqi convoy at Mutla' was portrayed as an all-out\\nslaughter.  This is simply not true.  The head and tail of the convoy\\nwas bombed initially, resulting in a lot of casualties at these points. \\n Before bombers came back, most of the rest of the Iraqi soldiers fled\\non foot. \\n\\nFurthermore, your estimates of Kuwaiti war dead if Allies hadn't invaded\\nis completely ridiculous.  You have acknowledged (certainly implicitly) \\n that Saddam is a barbarous brute.  You have acknowledged the hundreds\\nof thousands he has been responible for killing *in his own country*. \\nYou *know* that the man he appointed as governor of Kuwait,  Ali Majid,\\nwas his most brutal henchman, presiding over the near genocide of the\\nKurds  in the late 80's and, more recently, the Shi'a.

Later I met someone and married him, and now my name is\\nArutunian, my husband's name . . .\\n\\nThat there would be a massacre was not discussed openly, but there were hints \\nand gibes, so to speak, at the Armenian people, and they were mocking the \\nRussians, too. I was constantly aware of it at work, and not just this past \\nyear. I couldn't find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because \\nI, I'll just say it, couldn't steal, couldn't deceive, and couldn't be \\ninvolved in bribe-taking. And when I asked for decent working conditions they \\ntold me, \\\"Leave, don't keep the others from working, you aren't cut out for \\nthis kind of work.\\\" And at work and around all the time I would hear gibes at \\nthe Armenians, like \\\"The Turks had it right, they killed them all--the way\\nthey've multiplied here they're making it hard for us to live,\\\" and \\\"Things \\nwill be just fine if we get rid of them all.\\\" \\\"No problem, the Turks will \\nhelp,\\\" they say, \\\"if we ask them, they'll rid Armenia of Armenians in half an \\nhour.\\\" Well that's the way it all was, but I never thought, of course that it \\nwould spill over into a bloody tragedy, because you just couldn't imagine it. \\nHere we've been living under the Soviet government for 70 years, and no one \\neven considered such an idea possible.\\n\\nBut I had been forming my own opinions, and in the presence of authoritative \\npeople I would often ask, \\\"Where is this all leading, do people really not see\\nwhat kind of situation is emerging here. The Russians are fleeing Sumgait, \\nthere are very few of them left. Why is no one dealing with this, what's going\\non?\\\" And when it all happened on the 27th and 28th, it became clear that \\neverything had been arranged by someone, because what else are you to make of \\nit if the First Secretary of the City Party Committee is marching ahead of the\\ndemonstration with an Azerbaijani flag? I wouldn't be saying this now if I \\nhadn't received personal confirmation from him later. Because when we were \\nunder guard in the SK club on the 1st, he came to the club, that Muslimzade. \\nThe women told me, \\\"There he is, there he is, that's Muslimzade.\\\" I didn't \\nbelieve the rumors that he had carried an Azerbaijani flag. I thought that \\nthey were just false rumors. I went over to him and said, \\\"Are you the First \\nSecretary of our City Party Committee?\\\" He answers me, \\\"Yes.\\\" And I ask him, \\n\\\"Tell me, did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an Azerbaijani \\nflag, and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs, I don't know \\nexactly what they said, but there was mention of Armenian blood?\\\" And he tells\\nme, \\\"Yes, I was there, but I tried to dissuade them from it.\\\" Then I asked him\\nanother question: \\\"And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering \\nus? And he said, \\\"I. . . We didn't know what to do, we didn't know, we didn't \\nanticipate that that would happen in Sumgait.\\\"\\n\\nComrade Mamedov, the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the \\nAzerbaijani SSR, answered the same question for me: \\\"No, we actually didn't \\nanticipate the slaughter in Sumgait. At that time we were trying to contain \\nthe crowd of 45,000 in Baku that was preparing for a massacre.\\\" Those are his \\nexact words, the ones he said in the office of the Council of Ministers of the\\nArmenian SSR.\\n\\nAnd now, about the events themselves. Of course it's painful to discuss them, \\nbecause it may seem that it's not true to someone else. Various rumors \\nconcerning what happened are making the rounds: some are true, others aren't. \\nBut unfortunately there are more true ones than false, because it was so \\nhorrible: in our age, here in the space age, the age of science, the age of\\nprogress, I don't know, if someone had told me this story, if I were living in\\nor around Moscow, I wouldn't have believed it. Why not? Because it was really \\na genocide, it was a massacre. That's genuinely what it was.\\n\\nFor example, on that day, the 28th--I didn't know about the 27th because my \\nhusband and I were both sick, both of us had the flu, and we were in bed--on \\nthe 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says, \\\"You're in bed? You don't \\nknow anything about it? There was a demonstration in town, and after it they \\nwere overturning Armenian cars and burning them. They were looking into cars \\nand asking, 'Are you an Armenian?' If they answered in Armenian, then they \\nturned the car over and burned it.\\\" This isn't made up, the wife of the Senior\\nInvestigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us. He was \\nreturning home from his dacha with his wife, Raisa Sevastyanova, she's my \\nneighbor. She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the \\nmiddle of it, I don't know what to call it, the cavalcade of automobiles they \\nwere stopping. He answered in Azerbaijani, they let them go, but they made him\\nhonk the horn, they were kicking up a fracas. We didn't even believe it, and \\nI said, \\\"Certainly that didn't happen, how can that be?\\\" And she said, \\n\\\"Muslimzade was leading the crowd, and the Sputnik store was completely\\nsmashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians. And when he saw \\nthat they had started breaking the glass in that store, he said, \\\"Don't break \\nthe shop windows, don't destroy state property, but do whatever else you want.\\n\\\" I didn't hear this with my own two ears, but it is a fact that the store was\\ntorn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing Armenians \\nalthough he's an Azerbaijani.\\n\\nWhile we were talking, all of a sudden right across from us . . . Sevastyanova\\nis the first to look out the window and say, \\\"Look, there's a crowd out \\nthere.\\\" And sure enough, when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had \\nalready started wrecking the neighboring building. There was an Armenian \\nfamily there, a woman and two girls. They lived across from us. I'm sorry, I \\ndon't know the building number or the people's names, since we were in my \\nhusband's apartment, in Microdistrict 8, and I lived in Microdistrict No. 3. \\nThere was awful looting going on there at the time, the most hideous things \\nwere going on there then. One building there, ours, was attacked twice, once \\nwasn't enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn't finished\\nthe Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians, they \\nbeat the Azerbaijanis too. They also beat Russians, if it was Russians doing \\nthe hiding. Because there were Russians among them, they said so on \\ntelevision, there were people of various nationalities. But they didn't tell \\nus why there were people of different nationalities. Because they wouldn't \\nhave touched the Azerbaijanis if they hadn't dared to stick up for the \\nArmenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes.\\n\\nAt the time I saw this from the window I was there, Sevastyanova was there, \\nand so was my husband. We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly \\noff a balcony. All kinds of things, even a sofa. Then, when it was all down \\nthere, they burned it up. Then we saw the crowd, and they were all oohing. At \\nfirst I couldn't figure out what was happening. And later I told my husband, \\n\\\"Lendrush, l think they're beating someone out there.\\\" And he answered, \\\"I \\ndon't know, could be.\\\" Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and I saw \\nit, and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too. My husband had turned the other way, \\nhe didn't see it. I saw a naked girl with her hair down. They were dragging \\nher. She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. She fell \\ndown, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their \\nbalconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of \\nblocks, as far as the mortgage bank, that's a good block and a half or two \\nfrom here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself.\\n\\nThen the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there, and you can\\nof course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? And\\nI also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented\\nthat woman, because I had just seen that.\\n\\nI asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said, \\\"You kill me first, and then \\nlet them do what they want with the corpse.\\\" But our neighbors, it's true, \\ndefended us, they said, \\\"There aren't any Armenians in our entryway, go away, \\nonly Muslims live here.\\\" Disaster missed us that time.\\n\\nBut at two o'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people, approximately, \\ncame back to our place. My husband was already asleep. He can sleep when he's \\nupset about something, but I can't. I was standing, running from balcony to \\nbalcony. Our power was out, I don't remember for how long, but it was as \\nthough it had been deliberately turned off. There were no lights whatsoever, \\nand I was glad, of course. I thought it was better that way. But then I look \\nand the crowd is at our balcony. This was at 2:15 in the morning. The first \\ntime they were at our building it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the \\nmorning. But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the \\nAzerbaijani, was awake and watching out, there were human beings among them \\ntoo. So she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be taking\\ngarbage out at two o'clock in the morning. She used it as a pretext and went \\ntoward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you \\ncould see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke \\nAzerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said, \\\"What do you want?\\\" And \\nthey answered, \\\"We want the Armenian family that lives here\\\" [pointing toward \\nthe second floor with their hands]. She says, \\\"I already told you, we don't \\nhave any Armenians here, now leave, do you hear, this is an old Muslim woman \\ntalking to you,\\\" and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around\\nher and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away. And so they \\nseemed to listen to her. They were all very young, they started apologizing \\nand left. That was the second time death was at our door.\\n\\nI forgot to mention about one other apartment, a man named Rubik lives there, \\nI don't know him really, I knew his daughter, I mean I saw her around, but we \\nreally didn't know them. But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth \\nfloor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight \\nmonths, to earn money. Can you imagine what that means? He risked his life to \\nearn X amount of money in order to better his family. He bought new furniture \\nand was getting ready to give his daughter's hand in marriage, but, alas,\\neverything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels. They threw everything \\nout the windows, and the rest we saw from our balcony: how the neighbors on \\nthe left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that \\nhadn't already been smashed or taken. What is one to think of that? It means \\nthat the parents in those families were in on it too. Unfortunately I came to \\nbe of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been \\nforeseen in advance: both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of \\napartments. Something on the order of \\\"We'll move the Armenians out and take \\nover their apartments.\\\"\\n\\nI have worked honestly my whole life, you can check everything about me. I \\ncame as a patriot from China, waited for nights on end in front of the \\nConsulate General of the USSR, I came to my homeland as a patriot because I \\nknew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things. But when I saw in \\nSumgait that there wasn't anything holy about them, that Party membership was \\nbought, that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain, that there were \\nno ideals, no ideas, God save me, everything was being bought and sold, I saw \\nall of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did.\\n\\nI can't talk any more about it . . . the image of that beating . . . When I\\nwent out of my own apartment--they picked us up under Soviet Army guard, they \\nhad arrived from all over to suppress that gang--not only Armenians, but some \\nRussian families and their children, too, came out of their apartments and\\njoined us, because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with \\nthe situation the way it was. And what's interesting is that when we left on \\nthe buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people, for sure \\npeople would basically rise to the situation, would have some compassion for \\nthe Armenians, would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. But \\nhaving analyzed and weighed the whole thing, once I calmed down, having \\nthought it all through, I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people. \\nIf a lot of Azerbaijanis didn't want their Armenian neighbors to be killed, \\nand that basically depended on that Muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to \\ncalm them down--then is it possible that he didn't have people at hand to whom\\nhe could whisper at the last minute, \\\"Go and announce it on television: \\nCitizens of Sumgait! Take what you can into your hands, let's protect our \\nneighbors from this massacre?\\\" Those crowds weren't such that there was no \\ncontrolling them. Basically they were unarmed. They didn't have firearms, \\nmostly they had knives, they had all kinds of metal parts, like armature \\nshafts, sharpened at the ends, special rocks, different to a degree that we \\nnoticed them: there aren't rocks like those in Sumgait soils, they were \\nbrought from somewhere, as though it were all specially planned. So as I was \\nsaying, I weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend \\nus, why wasn't it arranged? It means that the government didn't want to do \\nit. When the crowd was moving from the City Party Committee to the Sputnik, \\nwhat, there was no way of informing Baku? No, there was no way, it turns out!\\nThe crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict. I won't mention the things \\nI didn't see myself, I'll only talk about the things I myself witnessed. They \\nwere in Microdistrict 8 beginning at 6 o'clock in the evening, when I saw them\\nfrom the other building, and they were somewhere else until mid-night or one \\no'clock in the morning, because at 2:15 they came back to our building. They\\nhadn't completely finished making their predatory rounds of Microdistrict 8. \\nWhen they returned to our building I told my husband, \\\"Lendrush, now the \\npolice are probably going to come, my God, now the authorities are probably \\ngoing to find out and come to our aid.\\\" Well, alas, no, there were to be no \\nauthorities, not a single policeman, not a single fireman, not a single \\nambulance came while they were raging, as it turns out, as we later found out,\\nbeginning on the Might of the 27th. There were dead people, ruined apartments,\\nand burned autos: one car near the bus station, it was burned and overturned, \\nit was probably there about four days, everyone saw it and what went on in \\nBlock 45! Those who live there know, they saw from their balconies how they \\nattacked the soldiers in the buses, how they beat those poor, unarmed\\nsoldiers, and how on that square, I can't remember the name of it, where there\\nis that fork coming from the bus station, that intersection, now I'm upset and\\nI can't think of the name . . . there's a tall building there, a 9-story, and \\nfrom the balconies there people saw that butchery, when the poor soldiers, \\nwearing only helmets, with shields and those unfortunate clubs, moved against \\nthat mob. And when they fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using \\nstones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on their heads. Who could have \\nguessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under \\nthe Soviet government? The upshot is that this republic has not been under \\nSoviet control for a long time, but no one wanted to pay any attention or get \\ninvolved.\\n\\nIf you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that I tell the\\ntruth, I've been struggling for truth for five years there already, the five \\nyears that I worked at the Azerbaijani railroad. Some people there considered \\nme a demagogue, others who knows what; some think I'm an adventure seeker, and\\nsome, a prankster. But I wanted everything to be right, I would become\\noutraged: how can this be, why is it people treat one another this way on a \\nSoviet railroad, as though the Azerbaijani railroad were Azerbaijani property,\\nor the property of some magnate, or some \\\"mafia\\\": If I want to, I'll get you \\nout of here; If I want to, I'll get rid of you; If I want to, I'll do \\nsomething else? And there's a black market price for everything, in the most \\nbrazen way: a coach to Moscow costs so much, a coach on a local train costs so\\nmuch. Once when I was complaining to the head of the conductor's pool, he had \\nthe nerve to tell me, maybe you won't even believe this, but this, I'm afraid,\\nI heard with my own ears: \\\"Tatyana, just how long can you fight for something\\nthat you know will never have any effect? You're alone against everyone, so \\ninstead why don't you give more money to the chief conductor, and everything \\nwill go fine for you.\\\" I started to cry, turned, and left. What else could I \\ndo, where else could I go to complain? I realized that everything was useless.\\nAnd the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see\\nit. I filed a written complaint, and they ground it into dust, they destroyed \\nit, I still have a copy, but what's the use? When the General Procuracy got \\ninvolved with the investigation of the bloody Sumgait affair, in addition to \\nthe information about what I saw, what I was a witness to, I gave testimony \\nabout the mafia at the railroad. They accepted my petition, but I don't know \\nif they're going to pursue it or not. Because, you'll excuse me, I no longer \\nbelieve in the things I aspired to, the things I believed in before: It's all \\ndead. They just spit on my soul, stomped on everything, physically, and most \\nimportant, spiritually, because you can lose belongings, that's nonsense, that\\nall comes with time, but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in \\nyou--your beliefs--are destroyed, it can be very difficult to restore them...\\n\\nI want to tell of one incident. I just don't know, at the time I was in such a\\nstate that I didn't even take minor things into account. Here is an example.\\nOf course, it's not a minor one. My neighbor, Raisa Sevastyanova, she has a\\nson, Valery, who is in the 9th grade in a school in Microdistrict 8. A boy,\\nVitaly [Danielian], I don't know his last name, goes to school with him, or\\nrather, went to school with him. I was just sitting in an apartment trying to\\nmake a phone call to Moscow . . . Oh yes, and there's one important detail:\\nWhen the massacre began, for two to three hours the phones weren't working in \\nArmenian apartments, and later, in several Russian and Azerbaijani apartments.\\nBut the fact of the matter is that service was shut off, you could not call \\nanywhere. Why? Again, it means it was all planned. How come service is cut off\\nfor no reason? And the lights went off. And those brats were raging as they\\nliked They weren't afraid, they ran about freely, they that no one would slap \\ntheir hands and no one would dare to stop them.  They knew it.\\n\\nNow I'm going to tell about the incident. So this little Vitaly, Vitalik, an\\nArmenian boy, went to school with Valery; they were in the same class. \\nAccording to what Valery and his neighbor pal said--at the time I was in the\\nsame apartment as they were, I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put\\nthrough--a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived. So Valery ran to\\nhis mother and said, \\\"Mamma, please let me go to Vitalik's, what if they kill\\nhim? Maybe he's still alive, maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow.\\n. . . He's a nice guy, we all like him, he's a good person, he's smart.\\\" His \\nmother wouldn't let him go. In tears, she says, \\\"Valery, you can't go because \\nI am afraid.\\\" He says, \\\"Mamma, we can get around the crowd. We'll just watch, \\njust have a look.\\\" They made it through. I don't know, I think Vitalik's\\nparents lived in Microdistrict No. 1, and when they got there, they made a \\nsuperficial deduction. Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken \\neverywhere, that you could see from the street which were the Armenian \\napartments in the building, they went here and there and looked, and saw that \\nthe windows were intact, and so they calmed down. But even though the windows \\nin that apartment were not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and \\nVitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already \\nbeen murdered. Little Vitalik didn't even know they were dead. So two weeks \\nago, I don't know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we \\nleft Sumgait on March 20, spent some time in Moscow, and then we came to \\nYerevan. So it's been about a month already; it's so hard to keep all this \\nstraight. So Valery, the next day, when he found out that Vitalik's family has\\nbeen killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku, Valery and\\nhis classmates got together and went to visit him. But they wouldn't admit \\nthem, telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in \\na coma. They cried and left, having also found out that the girl I saw being \\nkicked and dragged was in that hospital too. As it turns out she was brought \\nthere in serious condition, but at least she was alive at the time . . .\\n\\nWhen we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another, \\nthrow ourselves into their arms and kiss them, because you had wondered if \\nthese friends were alive or not, if those friends were alive or not  . . . And\\nwhen you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived! When\\nyou saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end.\\n\\nIf you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book. A book of \\nthings it is even difficult to believe. And those two girls who were raped \\nwere entirely black and blue, the ones at the SK, they know I'm not lying, \\nthat girlfriend came up to one of them and said, \\\"What happened?\\\" and she \\nbared her breasts, and they were completely covered in cigarette burns . . . \\nthose rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts. After something like that \\nI don't know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it.\\n\\nNow . . . When we stayed at the military unit for a while, they provided,\\nwell, basic conditions for us there. The military unit is located in Nasosny,\\nsome six miles from Sumgait. And living there we met with a larger group\\nof people. There were about 1,600 people at the unit. You know, there was a\\npoint when I couldn't even go outside because if you went outside you saw\\nso much heartbreak around you. And when you hear the false rumors . . .\\n\\nYes, by the way, false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armenians\\naround Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground\\nwith bulldozers. I didn't know whether to believe it or not. And people who \\ndon't know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge. But when \\nI arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak, and in Spitak all those villages are \\nnot only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in case, they \\nwere guarded, they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak. Not a \\nsingle person there died, and no one is planning to harm them. Around Yerevan \\nall the villages are safe and unharmed, and the Armenians didn't attack \\nanyone. But actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait there\\ncould have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don't\\nknow why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are \\nguilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread in\\nAzerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they not\\nonly perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. To them it \\nseems that the older person is telling the truth. For example, one says; \\\"Did \\nyou know that out of 31 people killed (by the way, originally they said 31 \\npeople, but later they found a 32nd), 30 were Azerbaijani and one was an \\nArmenian?\\\"\\n\\nOf course I'm upset, but it's utterly impossible to discuss such things and\\nnot become upset. Sometimes l forget things, but I know I want to return to\\nthe time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee.\\nWhen I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I \\ncouldn't believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner. I already\\nmentioned this, and if I repeat anything, please excuse me. I asked him, \\\"Why \\ndid you do that and why are you here now, why did you come here? To laugh at \\nthese women who are strewn about on the floor?\\\" The overcrowding there was \\ntremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children were\\nalready sick. It's true the troops tried to make it livable for us. They \\ncooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but \\nthe thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at \\nit everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. Plus they \\nwere never given any direct orders, they didn't know what they were authorized\\nto do and not to do. And it was only on March 8 at five o'clock in the evening\\nthat Krayev himself, the Lieutenant General, the City Commandant of Sumgait, \\nwas given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored \\npersonnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart \\nadvised him, and relocate people to the military unit.\\n\\nBut that's not what I want to talk about now. Muslimzade, characteristically, \\ntried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party\\nCommittee, which is across the square from the club. He took me by the\\nhand and said, \\\"Citizen, don't worry, we'll go and have a talk in my office.\\nI told him, \\\"No, after everything you've done, I don't believe one iota of \\nwhat you say. If I go to the City Party Committee I'll disappear, and the \\ntraces of me will disappear too. Because you can't stand it when . . . \\\" Oh \\nyes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. It was even \\nvery funny, although at the time I wasn't up to laughing. He was in a nice, \\nexpensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, I said, \\\"Oh, why \\ndid you come here all duded up like a London dandy, you smell of good perfume,\\nyou're in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. You came\\nto ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who are\\nalready getting sick, whose relatives have died. Did you come to laugh at\\nthem?\\\" And the one who was accompanying him, an Azerbaijani, I don't know who \\nhe was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade's head \\nand hid it. Then I said, \\\"My God! We're not marauders. We're not you! We \\ndidn't come to you with the intention of stealing!\\\" \\\"Well kill me, kill me!\\\" \\nMuslimzade says to me, \\\"But I'm not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but I'm not\\nguilty.\\\" And I say, \\\"OK, fine, you're not guilty, have it your way. But give \\nus an answer, we're asking you: Where were you when they were torturing and \\nraping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things, \\ncarrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? Where were you \\nthen?\\\" \\\"You know, we didn't expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn't \\nanticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait.\\\" I started \\nlaughing and said, \\\"It's truly funny.\\\" He says, \\\"What could I do? We didn't \\nknow what to do.\\\" And I say, \\\"I'm sorry, but it'll be ridiculous if I tell \\nyou: The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn't march out in \\nfront with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross \\nover his dead body. That's what you should have done. That's the way it was \\nduring the war. Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself;\\neither he died or he led people into battle. And what did you do? You ran \\naway, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid, \\nexcuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. And when we ask you, \\nyou tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done? \\nThat's right,\\\" I told him, \\\"the City party committee got confused, all the \\nparty committees got confused, the police got confused,. Baku got confused, \\nthey all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with \\nimpunity. And if it weren't for the troops it wouldn't have been just two \\ndays, there wouldn't be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure, they would \\nhave finished their bloody affair, because they brazenly went up to some \\nRussians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and they told \\nthem, 'As soon as we finish with the Armenians we'll come after you, too.\\\"\\n\\nAnd by the way, there was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. He was\\nthe one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later\\narrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us to\\nthe military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. We \\nasked him, \\\"What? How? What will come of us?\\\" He openly said, \\\"You know, for \\nus the main thing now is to catch that gang. We'll finish that quickly. You'll\\nstay at the military unit for the time being, and we'll decide later.\\\" The \\nGeneral Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all \\ncities. There were some from Stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because \\nthe affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke;\\nas everyone knows, he's the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When \\nhe gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit, \\nby the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn't not say it, \\nbecause he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen, \\nand he said, \\\"There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it's\\nhorrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely \\npunished, in accordance with our laws.\\\" And that's a quote. Then one mother \\nthrows herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says,\\n\\\"Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?\\\" They tried \\nto calm her down, and he said, \\\"In order for us to conduct a proper \\ninvestigation, in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility, you \\nmust help us, because we don't know, maybe there was someone else in the gang \\nwho is now being concealed in homes, and maybe the neighbors know, maybe \\nsomeone saw something. Don't be afraid, write about it in detail. So that \\nyou're not afraid . . . Everyone knows that many of you are afraid, having \\nlived through such horrors, they think that if they write the whole truth \\nabout, let's say, their neighbor or someone else, that they will seek revenge \\nlater. We're going to do it like this: We're going to set up an urn and you \\ncan throw what you write in there. We don't need to know who wrote it. The \\nnames of the people who write won't be made public, but we need all the\\ninformation. Let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is \\nnecessary, who they saw in that gang, who made threats or shouted threatening \\ngibes about the Armenians . . . You must describe all of these people and put \\nthe information into the urn.\\\"\\n\\nTwo soldiers and a major guarded the urn. And, sure enough, many people, \\npeople who didn't even want to write . . .I know one woman who asked me, she \\ncame up and said, \\\"You, as a Russian, the same thing won't happen to you as \\nwill happen to me. So please . . . I'll give you the information, and you \\nplease write it down for me.\\\" So she was afraid, and there were a lot like\\nher . . . But later, after Katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote down\\neverything she knew. And we threw it all into the urn. Now we don't know if \\nit will be of any use. For a factual picture will emerge from all that \\ninformation. One person can lie, but thousands can't lie, thousands simply \\ncan't lie. You have to agree with that, a fact is a fact. Why, for example, \\nshould someone say that black is white if it is really black?\\n\\n   The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani\\nSSR, Mamedov, as I said, was in Yerevan. My husband and I were at the Council \\nof Ministers of the Armenian SSR and found out that Mamedov was present, the \\none who had come to convince the people of Sumgait to  return to their \\nprevious dwellings, to their old apartments. We asked for a meeting with him, \\nand it was granted. When we went to see him he tried to behave properly, very \\npolitely, delicately, but . . . when the truth was told right to his face and \\nwhen I asked him some of the same questions I had asked Muslimzade, \\\"Where were\\nyou personally when they were beating us? Now you're trying to convince us to \\nreturn, why didn't you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where \\nit was all leading?\\\" he says, \\\"You're telling the truth. Let's not mince \\nwords. You've told me right to my face, and I'll tell you straight. I'll tell \\nyou the pure truth. I was gotten out of bed in the evening, the whole \\ngovernment was up, including me, and we were restraining a crowd of about \\n45,000 in Baku. But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait, with its \\nfine international record, such a thing could happen. We expected it in Baku.\\\"\\nI say, \\\"So that means you expected it all the same? Why were you expecting \\nit?\\\" And he says, \\\"You know, it just happened that way. We were expecting it \\nin Baku, we were trying to restrain it, but in Sumgait . . . \\\" I say, \\\"Fine, \\nyou didn't know for the first three or four hours, but then you should have \\nknown. Why did no one help us?\\\" And he says, \\\"Well, OK, we didn't know what to\\ndo\\\" and things like that. Basically it was the same story I got from \\nMuslimzade. Later, when he said, \\\"You go on back, the situation in Sumgait is \\nfavorable now, everything is fine, the Armenians are friendly with the \\nAzerbaijanis . . . \\\" To this l answered, \\\"You know what . . . I'm speaking \\nwith you as a [member of a] neutral nation . . . I have never argued with \\nArmenians or with Azerbaijanis and I was an eyewitness . . . You tell me, \\nplease, Comrade Mamedov, \\\" I asked him, \\\"What would you say about this\\nhonestly, if you were being completely frank with us?\\\" Then he said, \\\"Yes, I \\nadmit that I am honestly ashamed, shame on the entire Azerbaijani nation, we \\nhave disgraced ourselves not only before the entire Soviet Union, but before \\nthe whole world. Because now the Voice of America and all the other foreign \\nradio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors, too.\\\"\\nAnd I say, \\\"There's nothing to add to what really happened. I don't think it's\\npossible to add anything more awful.\\\" He says, \\\"Yes, I agree with you, I \\nunderstand your pain, it is truly an unfortunate occurrence.\\\" I repeat that he\\nsaid \\\"unfortunate occurrence.\\\" And then he suddenly remembered himself, what \\nhe was saying--he had a pen in his hands, he was fidgeting with it nervously--\\nand said, \\\"Oh, excuse me, a tragedy, really . . . \\\" I take this to mean that \\nhe really thinks it's an \\\"unfortunate occurrence.\\\" \\\"And of course,\\\" he says, \\n\\\"I understand that having gone through all this you can't return to Sumgait, \\nbut it's necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being \\ntried.\\\" And he even gave a detail, which, I don't know if it matters or not, \\nthat 160 policemen were being tried. Specifically in relation to that bloody \\naffair.\\n\\nYes, by the way, there is another good detail, how I was set up at work in\\nBaku after the events. I went to an undergarment plant, there was an \\nAzerbaijani working there, and suddenly she tells me, \\\"What, they didn't\\nnail your husband? They screwed up.\\\" I was floored, I hadn't imagined that\\nanyone in Baku, too, could say something like that. Well after that I went up\\nto see . . . to my office, I needed to find out about those days, what was\\ngoing to happen with them, how they were going to put down those days from \\nFebruary 29 to March 10 . . . and the administrator told me, \\\"I don't know, \\nTatyana, go to the head of the conductors' pool. Be grateful if they don't \\nput it down as unexcused absence.\\\" I was really discouraged by this. They all \\nknow that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived, and here \\nthey're telling me that I was skipping work, as though I was off enjoying \\nmyself somewhere. I went to the office of the chief of the pool, his last name\\nis Rasulov, and he's had that position for many years. Incidentally, he's a \\nParty member, and is a big man in town. And suddenly, when I went to him and \\nsaid, \\\"Comrade Rasulov, this is the way it was . . . \\\" He looked at me askance\\nand said, \\\"And why are you\\\"--he knows me by my previous last name--\\\"why did\\nyou get wrapped up in this mess?\\\" I say, \\\"What do you mean, why did I get \\nwrapped up in this mess? My husband's an Armenian,\\\" I tell him, \\\"I have an \\nArmenian last name.\\\" And he screwed up his face, made a kind of a grimace, as \\nthough he had eaten something sour, and said, \\\"I didn't expect that you would\\n. . . \\\" What did he mean by that? And \\\"how\\\" should he behave, the chief of the\\npool, a man who supervises 1,700 workers? Now, it's true, there was a \\nreduction, but for sure there are still 1,200 conductors working for him. And \\nif someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that, then what \\ncan you expect from a simple, uneducated, politically unsophisticated person?!\\nHe's going to believe any and all rumors, that the Armenians are like this, \\nthe Armenians are like that, and so on . . .\\n\\nBy the way, that Mamedov--now I'm going back to Mamedov's office when I asked \\nhim \\\"Are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return \\nto Sumgait?\\\" he answered, \\\"Yes, you know, I would guarantee them . . . I don't\\nwant to take on too much, I would guarantee them firmly for 50 years. But I \\nwon't guarantee them for longer than 50 years.\\\" I say, \\\"So you've got another\\nthing like that planned for 50 years from  now? So they'll be quiet and then \\nin another 50 years it'll happen again?!\\\" I couldn't contain myself any more,\\nand I also told him, \\\"And how did it get to that point, certainly you knew\\nabout it, how they were treating the Russians, for example, in Baku and in \\nSumgait, how they were hounded from their jobs? Certainly you received\\ncomplaints, I wrote some myself. Why did no one respond to them? Why did \\neveryone ignore what was going on? Didn't you prepare people for this by the \\nway you treated them?\\\" And he says, \\\"You know, you're finally starting to \\ninsult me!\\\" He threw his pen on the desk. \\\"Maybe now you'll say I'm a \\nscoundrel too?\\\" I say, \\\"You know, I'm not talking about you because I don't \\nknow. But about the ones who I do know I can say with conviction, yes, that \\ncomrade was involved in this, that, and that, because I know for certain.\\n\\\"Well anyway he assured us that here, in Yerevan, there were false rumors, \\nthat 3,000 Sumgait Armenians were here, and 15,000 were in Sumgait and had \\ngotten back to work. Everyone was working, he said, and life was very good. \\n\\\"We drove about the town ourselves, Comrade Arutiunian [First Secretary of \\nthe Communist Party of Armenia SSR] came from the Council of Ministers of \\nArmenian, he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in\\nSumgait.\\\" When I asked Mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said, '\\n\\\"Well, I walked down the street.\\\" And I said, \\\"Walking down the street in any \\ncity, even if I were to go to New York, I would never understand the situation\\nbecause I would be a guest, I don't have any contact with people, but if you \\nspend 10 days among some blue-collar workers in such a way that they didn't \\nknow you were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, you'd \\nhear something quite different.\\\" I told him, for example, that I drew my \\nconclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments. They took\\nus all in turns to pick things up, since people had fled to the military unit;\\nthey got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible. How are the \\nneighbors in the microdistrict, how will they view us, what do they think? I \\nthought maybe that in fact it wasn't something general, of a mass nature, some\\nanti-national something. And when that bus took us to our building, because it\\nwas the same bus, while we were going up to our apartment, an armed soldier \\naccompanied us. What does that say? It speaks of the fact that if everything \\nthere were fine, why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with\\nus, going from apartment to apartment? And in fact, especially with the young \\npeople, you could sense the delight at our misfortune, the grins, and they \\nwere making comments, too. And that was in the presence of troops, when police\\ndetachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and \\ntanks were passing by. And if people are taking such malicious delight when \\nthe situation is like that, then what is it going to be like when they \\nwithdraw protection from the city altogether?

In the\\nGerman Weimar system, the Chancellor was not necessarily the leader of the\\nlargest Reichstag party; the Chancellor was appointed by the President and\\ngenerally was the leader of a coalition of parties who could form an effective\\nmajority in the Reichstag. Beyond that, the implication that Hitler rose to\\nthe Chancellorship because a majority of Germans wanted Nazi rule is false\\nas well. Before President Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor in January\\n1933, the German people did not show a particular desire to be led either by\\nHitler or by the Nazi party. These are the results of the March 1932 election\\nfor President, the closest Hitler ever came to direct election: Hindenburg\\n49.6%, Hitler 30.1%, Thaelmann 13.2%, Duesterberg 6.8%. In the runoff election\\nin April the results were: Hindenburg 53%, Hitler 36.8%, Thaelmann 10.2%.\\nSo we can see that Hitler personally was supported by only about a third of\\nGerman voters.\\n\\nSimilarly, the Nazi party never received more than 37% of the vote in\\nReichstag elections. That occurred in July 1932. In the November 1932 election\\nthe Nazis *lost* two million votes and 34 seats, down from 230 to 196 out of\\nthe 608 in the Reichstag. Comparitively, the Socialists had 121 and the\\nCommunists 100. The Communists had gained 11 seats, and the German National\\nparty, which had supported the previous government, had picked up a million\\nof the Nazis' lost votes to gain 15 seats (up to 52). I think the other large\\nparty was the Catholic Center party (I don't know how many seats they had but\\nI think they were declining), and there were numerous other small parties.\\nThus the Nazi vote was on the decline at the time Hitler was appointed\\nChancellor.\\n\\nWhat brought Hitler to power was *not* the demand of the German people for\\nHitler or the Nazis to run things, but the inability of the other parties to\\nput their differences behind them in favor of forming an effective government\\nfor the country. Germany did not have an enduring democratic tradition, and\\ntheir parliamentary system lacked effective center parties that favored the\\ninterests of the majority of the population. Instead what they had was a\\nnumber of small parties who were unable to put aside their own specific\\nobjectives in order to combine against the Nazis, who were out to end the\\ndemocratic process. In fact, part of the problem was that some of the other\\nparties with substantial representation, like the Communists, were also\\nout to end the democratic process, but with different results in mind, and\\ngenerally didn't mind seeing parliamentary democracy go under.\\n\\nGermany had already had a non-Nazi Chancellor with a majority coalition\\nfor five months while the Nazis had been the largest Reichstag party, and\\nthere certainly was no danger of a revolution in favor of the Nazis.\\nIf anything the Nazis were starting to get desperate because they had failed\\nto get enough support to make Hitler President and their popular vote had\\nbegun to decline.\\n\\nHitler was not Hindenburg's first choice to be Chancellor, not even his\\nsecond choice. First, von Papen had been Chancellor since June 1932. After\\nthe November election when the Nazis *lost* seats, Hindenburg first prevailed\\non von Papen to remain as Chancellor. But there were intrigues behind his back\\nand support for him was lacking. So then Hindenburg turned to von Schleicher,\\nwho became Chancellor for two months. Eventually he too was unable to hold\\ntogether a working coalition of parties to oppose the Nazis, who refused to\\nparticipate in any government that was not led by a Nazi Chancellor. Some of\\nthe Nazi leadership, particularly Gregor Strasser who was the #2 man in the\\nparty at the time, wanted to participate in a coalition government. But others,\\nknowing the party's support was waning, figured that their best hope to gain\\npower lay in undermining the democratic process. Nevertheless, the country\\nwas governed for seven months by Chancellors who were not Nazis, even though\\nthe Nazis were the largest Reichstag party. The failure of these men to\\nachieve a working coalition was due to the inability of their coalition\\nparties to work together.\\n\\nHere's how William Shirer puts it in _The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich_:\\n\\n   The cardinal error of the Germans who opposed Nazism was their\\n   failure to unite against it. At the crest of their popular strength,\\n   in July 1932, the National Socialists had attained but 37 percent of\\n   the vote. But the 63 percent of the German people who expressed their\\n   opposition to Hitler were much too divided and shortsighted to combine\\n   against a common danger which they must have known would overwhelm\\n   them unless they united, however temporarily, to stamp it out.\\n\\nTrue, the German people supported Hitler after he became Chancellor. But\\nthat doesn't change the fact that there was not overwhelming support for him\\n*before* he was in power. The German people were not crying out for Hitler to\\ntake over, no matter how bad economic conditions were. The leftist parties\\n(Socialists\\u002fCommunists) probably had more support in total than the Nazis.\\nHitler used the fact that others were passively or actively willing to see\\nthe government paralyzed as a means to taking it over.\\n\",\"I  must  finally  admit the total truth that is central to the\\ncore of my being.\\n\\n   I  am  a  homosexual.   Not  just  a  normal,  run-of-the-mill\\nhomosexual,  but  a  rabid homosexual Zionist.  I hide behind the\\nfacade  of  pro-Israel  rhetoric so as to deflect suspicion of my\\ntrue  motive:  the exchange of romantic dialogue with Nick Steel,\\nand  our  frequent  fudge-packing   adventures,  which   we  have\\nendeavored  to maintain at a discreet level.  Of course, the need\\nfor discretion has been obviated by my own admission here.\\n\\n   The  truth  is  that  I  could  no longer hold this saccharine\\nsecret  any  longer.   I love  you,  Nick,  and  my  love for you\\nsurpasses  that  which  I  hold  for Eretz Yisrael, may she stand\\nforever, as our love has, and as your erection insinuating itself\\ninto my kosher rectum always will.\\n\",\"\\n\\nSo far, you have presented your opinions as opposed to mine.

Even more, I\\ncould show you a lot of meanings that words in Spanish have different\\nfrom those in the dictionary.\\n\\n\\nAnd guess why. Isn't it curious that we do not know how many people define \\nin how many different ways the term Jew, which is the basis of the movement \\nitself?\\nSo, the evidence shows that up to now, Jew, when considered in terms of Israel,\\nthe Law of Return and Jewish Nationality is defined in terms of religion and\\nnot of cultural identity, even if 80% of those defined as Jews in Isreal\\nare not religious.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat IS a problem. I am saying that I do not support Zionism as it is\\nnow. I believe that among the people in the Soviet Communist Party some\\nmight even had been inspired by noble ideals. Does that change the\\nfinal results of what happened in the USSR?\\nIn the same way, even if the Zionist movement is not homogeneous, it\\ndoes not matter. What matters is the result.\\n\\n\\nI never said it directly nor indirectly. I am not talking about individuals\\nwho defined themselves as zionists here. I am sure most of them are good,\\nhonest and caring people. I am talking about the results of the Zionist\\nMovement. I am talking about a Movement whose actions resulted in a\\nLaw of Return with a religious definition of Jew, a country that defines\\nnationality based on religion. I am talking about something I consider\\na form of racism such as differenciation based on religious belief. \\nAfter all, if Arabs in Israel cannot serve in the Army is becasue they \\nwere not born in the \\\"right\\\" religion.\\n\\n\\nI had never heard the definition: Only those who are religious are defined as Jews.\\nI had always seen the definition: A person is a Jew is his\\u002fher mother is\\u002fwas\\na Jew, and if such person does not convert, although I had seen people\\nargue about the last part.\\n\\n\\nSo, there is no difference between citizenship and nationality in Israel?\\nOr what do you mean by \\\"Actually, it doesn't\\\"?\\n\\n\\nSo, it follows a religious definition and not a cultural one. That is what\\nI call a form of racism.\\n\\n\\nYou do not need to assume the representation of \\\"everybody else\\\" to \\nmake your points. You should assume that you are just talking for yourself.\\nAbout the other stuff, I still believe that the example was a valid one.\\nIt would be a hypocrisy to say that one supports nationalism for all and\\nthen support Zionism and then disregard the Palestinian's right.\\n\\n\\nIt was an example.

I posted in another post the definition of Zionism. And, in\\nthis post you have showed for me what I was telling you from the \\nbegining. Zionism is a form of racism, even if most zionists are not\\nracist in their individual and private lifes. A movement that ask\\nfor a State and National rights for a people, and then in practice,\\nthat people are defined according to religion is, for me, racist-like.\\n\\n\\nYou did it.

On reaching Arminam 'Armeniya'.\\n\\n 7. To the country town of Zozo, to Armaniya 'Armeniya'.\\n\\nAccording to Karakashian:\\n\\nAs for 'Armenia', the equivalent of the 'Armin' or 'Arminik' of the Persians,\\nthis is more recent than the word 'Ararat', and is to be found used in\\nthe Dara inscriptions for 'Haiastan'.  \\n\\nSaint Martin:\\n\\nThe name 'Armenie' has been given since very early times by almost all\\nthe various eastern peoples to the territory referred to by the Armenians\\nas 'Haiastan'. It was known to the Syrians as Armenia and to the Arabs\\nas Ermeniyye.\\n \\nOthers believe that Urartu was known in the time of the Medes as 'Harminap'\\nwhich was later modified by the Persians to 'Arminia'. 'Ar' refers to a\\nplace, as in Ararat, Archish, Aruyr, Archar, Arshav, Arazen and Aror, \\nwhile 'men' is used to refer to spirit, thought or human being, and \\ntherefore 'Armen' would appear to signify 'the people of that place'.\\n\\nG. Alishan believes that 'according to our national vocabulary \\\"Haik\\\"\\nis the diminutive form of \\\"Hai\\\", and that \\\"Hai\\\" is the name of our\\nnation. Our nation is in no way connected with the word \\\"Armen\\\" that\\nforeigners apply to our people.'\\n\\nIt would thus appear that 'Armenia' is a place-name, that 'Armen' is \\nthe name of the people who lived there, and that these are in no way\\nconnected with the word 'Hai'.\\n\\nHaik and Haiastan:\\n\\nArmenian historians believe Haik to have been a great hero from whom\\nthe Armenian people took the name 'Hai'. But the mere resemblance\\nbetween the words 'Haik' and 'Hai' constitutes no real proof, and,\\nin any case, no such theory appears before the time of Moses of\\nKhoren.\\n\\nHaiasa:\\n\\nThe following studies show quite clearly that 'Hai' and 'Haiasa' were\\nno more than general names used by the Hittites to refer to the \\nregion known as Armenia.\\n\\nProfessor Hachadurian: 'Haiasa was the general name used in Hittite\\ninscriptions for Upper Armenia.'\\n\\nYensen, in his 'Hittites and Armenians' tries to prove that 'Hai' is\\nidentical with the Hittite 'Hatio', in other words that 'Hai' is a\\nHittite word. Research, however, has proved this erroneous, and shown\\nthat 'Hai' was derived from 'Hatio'.\\n\\nMortman's attempt to read the Urartu inscriptions as Armenian met with \\nno success. As for Greek, there is no point in even mentioning it.\\n\\nThe resemblance between the words 'Haiasa' and 'Haiastan' is so obvious\\nthat we may well accept 'Haiasa' as the oldest form of 'Haiastan'.\\n\\nLet us now cast a brief glance on how the words 'Hai', 'Haikazan' and\\n'Haiastan' entered our older works.\\n\\nAccording to Karakashian: \\n\\n'The word \\\"Haik\\\" is never to be found employed with reference to a\\nleader of the Armenian people prior to Moses of Khoren, nor is it\\never found employed in the forms \\\"Haika\\\" or \\\"Haykazn\\\".\\n\\nAgahangelos and Puzant use the word as a title or a place-name (he\\nimproved and developed Haiastan, etc.). If the word had referred\\nto a nation and had been derived from \\\"Hai\\\" or \\\"Haik\\\" they could \\nalso have used the words \\\"Haikak\\\" and \\\"Haykazn\\\" in a number of\\nplaces.'\\n\\nAccording to Professor Sayce, who deciphered a number of Hittite \\ninscriptions:\\n\\n'In the Hittite language the suffix -ha is used to specify quality\\nor species. The words \\\"Haddanas\\\", \\\"Haddina\\\" were used by the \\nAssyrians to refer to the Hittites. With the transformation of the\\n\\\"d\\\" between the two \\\"a\\\" letters to \\\"y\\\" \\\"Hadinasdani\\\" was in this\\nway transformed to \\\"Haiastan\\\"'.\\n\\nProfessor Grechmer fully agrees with this point of view, but regards\\nthe significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms 'Hai'\\nand 'Haistan' as quite unsatisfactory. He finds, however, that a \\nsolution to this problem is brought nearer by the name 'Haiasa' \\nwhich is so frequently found in Bogazkoy from 1400 B.C. onwards.\\nForrer takes 'Haiasa' as referring to Upper Armenia. In that case\\nit seems likely that 'Haiasa' was actually a part of Armenia. The\\nsuffix -dan is of Anatolian origin. The real root is 'Hayasa', which\\nrefers to the country of the 'Hayasas'.\\n\\nE. Chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological \\nand Anthropological characteristics of the Armenian people.\\n\\nThe Armenians in Russia may be characterized as follows: Almost\\nall of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic, very dark,\\nabove average height, an Aissores Asian group with close ties\\nwith certain Kurdish tribes and Azerbaijan peoples.\\n\\nAccording to J. Deniker:\\n\\nFrom the philological point of view, the Armenian and Kurds may be\\nregarded as belonging to the Iranian group...The Armenians are \\ndescended from various elements and from a very mixed race.

Too bad I can't go.\",\"(sci.space readers can skip the first paragraph)\\n\\n  Yesterday, in response to Henry Spencer's question about the \\ntemperature of a blackbody in interstellar space, I said \\\"Dust grains\\nacts as blackbodies, and they're at 40-150 K.\\\"  Well, I was dead\\nwrong.  Our local interstellar dust expert, Bruce Draine, has\\ninformed me that dust grains _aren't_ good radiators in the far IR,\\nwhich is why they are so warm; actually, the ambient radiation field\\nfrom distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only 3 or 4 Kelvin.\\nSorry, Henry, and anyone else I misled.  Obviously, time for me to\\ntake another ISM class :-(\\n\\n  In other news, Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute gave\\na talk on the Pluto-Charon binary system yesterday.  He gave a brief\\noverview of the currently-accepted system parameters (volume ratio of\\nabout 8:1, mass ratio about 15:1 or so, plus lots more...) and then\\ngave his thoughts on the formation of Pluto-Charon.  His idea is \\nthat there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer\\nsolar system, with masses distributed as a power law of some kind;\\nover time, the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies.  Most got\\nscattered out of the solar system by close encounters with Jupiter\\nand Saturn, but many accreted into the gas giants, especially\\nUranus and Neptune.  A large planetesimal was captured by Neptune -\\nwe call it Triton [captured how?  Perhaps by a collision with a smaller,\\nalready-existing Neptunian moon, perhaps by a very close passage through\\nNeptune's atmosphere - mondo aerobraking!].\\n\\n  He notes that the two recently discovered \\\"Kuiper Belt\\\" objects,\\n1992 QB1 and 1993 FW, plus Chiron and Pholus, are all about the same \\nmass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the\\nlarger bodies of Triton and Pluto\\u002fCharon.  Pluto\\u002fCharon, he thinks,\\nformed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto, knocking some material\\ninto a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon; similar to\\nideas about the formation of Earth's moon.  There is good evidence\\nfrom spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different\\n(Pluto has methane frost, Charon doesn't), which can be used as evidence\\nfor the impact theory.\\n\\n  He believes that there may be around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objects\\nremaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune's \\norbit, beyond 35 AU or so.  1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first members\\nof this population to be found, in his model.  Note that such bodies\\nwill be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane \\nfrost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbons\\nby now.  The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, I think)\\nis that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate,\\nand when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it forms\\nbright, new frost.  So any bodies much farther away than 30 AU are going\\nto be very hard to see.\\n\\n  I hope I haven't made any errors in the transcription; if you see\\na howling mistake, it's undoubtedly mine, not his.\\n\\n  By the way, he's one of the top guns behind the Pluto Fast Flyby\\nmission (I think), and said that the current plans are to use a\\nTitan 4 to send the probe on \\\"just about a rectilinear trajectory\\\"\\nto Pluto (we were speaking loosely at the time...).  He'd like\\nto use a Proton, which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs\\nMUCH less.  His figures: $500 Million for 2 Titan 4 launches (there\\nwill be two separate probes, launched separately), or $120 Million\\nfor 2 Proton launches.  He told a story about how the Soviets originally\\noffered to sell Proton launches for $30 Million each, but were forced\\nto increase their prices in the US in order to be allowed in the\\nmarketplace.\\n\\n  I'm just telling you what he said.\\n\\n                          Michael\\n\",\"\\n   I assume that can only be guessed at by the assumed energy of the\\n   event and the 1\\u002fr^2 law.  So, if the 1\\u002fr^2 law is incorrect (assume\\n   some unknown material [dark matter??] inhibits Gamma Ray propagation),\\n   could it be possible that we are actually seeing much less energetic\\n   events happening much closer to us?  The even distribution could\\n   be caused by the characteristic propagation distance of gamma rays \\n   being shorter then 1\\u002f2 the thickness of the disk of the galaxy.\",\" \\n\\n[\\\"it\\\" is Big Bang]\\n\\nSince you asked... from the Big Bang to the formation of atoms is about\\n10E11 seconds. As for the \\\"color\\\": bright. Very very bright. \\n\\n\\nI don't. I believe the current theory of cosmology because it is fairly\\nwell supported by observational evidence (not as well supported as, say\\nevolution or relativity, but that's another matter). You're the one who\\nproposes unquestioningly accepting religious dogma as fact (apologies if\\nyou're not actually a creationist).\\n\\n\\nThe line is broader than you think.

(Due to the prevailing assumption \\nthat the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)\\n\\n  The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the \\ndevelopment of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications \\nof BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!\\n\\n  REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!\\n\\n  \\n1\\n  I dream like this: ether based reality\\n \\n  The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations \\nstart as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices\\nboth drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it, \\nconverting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy. \\n(non-spinning lattice = \\\"dark matter\\\")\\n\\n  The earth isn't exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image \\nof a galaxy; we haven't any videos of them spinning. Picture us \\nbeing stationary, and the sun's image being dragged across the sky by \\nthe spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is \\nspinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner \\nkernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a \\nfaster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground \\nof the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but \\nits \\\"foot print\\\" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])\\n  \\n  The moon isn't exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self \\nspin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth's ether field, which is \\nitself in the sun's much more powerful field. Our seasons are the \\nwobble of earth's axis, like a top slowing down. The \\\"orbit\\\" of the\\nearth around the sun is all of the stars' images being dragged around\\nby the sun's ether feild.\\n\\n  The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and \\\"distance\\\" \\napart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because \\nthe \\\"path\\\" is not the same. The moon's lattice in the ether is like \\nsticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half \\nturn. The sun's lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has \\ngot the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to \\nthe moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a \\\"j\\\" hook at \\nthe end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the \\nwhole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there. \\n\\n  With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon \\ncan be about as big as \\\"earth's\\\" shadow upon it, and at other times \\ntotally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge, \\nwould you guess that they are about the same size, just because they \\nlook about the same size?\\n\\n   O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S\\n E       \\u002f     \\\\            \\n    M    |      |      OR                M    \\n         \\\\ _ _ \\u002f                         \\n       S                           \\n       \\n  The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate\\nof ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating \\\"turntable view\\\" \\nof the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I've seen a \\nhalf moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the \\nday. Try and draw that \\\"earth shadow.\\\") Its only the moon's image \\nwhich appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is \\nthe part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away \\nfrom the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.\\n\\n  \\\"Light-Years\\\" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is \\ncloser to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase \\nof reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion. \\n(defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be \\nessentially happening now. The \\\"piece\\\" of light may have experienced \\nmany years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.\\n\\n  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to \\nde-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design \\na propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like \\ntrying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)\\n\\n  To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I'd \\nlook in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just \\nmight carry decipherable data. I'd start looking on some part of the \\nspectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+ \\nbillion humans?) I'd totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG \\nbackwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card \\nfor Pentium!)\\n\\n  Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound \\nmedia, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I \\nwould try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which \\nI'd start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole. \\n[Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a \\ntwo foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I \\ncould get with my machine's receiver next to it.  \\n\\n  If you don't think you'll live to see it, consider this: QUIT \\nPUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of \\nlife's data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our \\nthoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By \\neating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant \\ninstructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or \\nbiblical guys did live hundreds of years. I'm curios to see what \\nthey did and ate. Don't worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we \\ndon't need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and \\nthat is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where \\ndid the household concept 'immortal' come from? Wheat is a weed, it \\nis programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then \\ndie)\\n\\n  Warning about writing to the past:\\nI had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel \\nfuture, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from. \\nThere were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an \\nOscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us, \\nand then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the \\nothers into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by \\n\\\"advising\\\" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into \\nreproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that \\nthe little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to \\nprovide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it \\nin his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his \\ncontrol. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying \\nthat there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve \\nsouls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was \\nfinite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in \\nour reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it \\nseemed odd, but we couldn't remember how else it should be. Then \\nsome of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no \\nmore, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped \\nthrough his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that \\nhe had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body, \\nexisting only on the wind. \\n\\n  MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls \\nwhose will's are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat \\nothers as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a \\nlonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for \\nplaymates. (its not eternal, there's more than one way back) \\n\\n Accepting rides to the past:\\nOnce here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a \\nPrince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go \\nahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry. \\nI Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes \\nyour work, but thinks you're getting wise, he can direct you to cross \\npaths with your old self, and you'll vanish as you rewrite your own \\ncourse of history, none the wiser.\\n\\n  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped \\nback in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still \\nmake changes while he's here, its just that that is work, and with \\nevery 'adjustment', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which \\nloosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. \\nBut he can't see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had \\nto apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand \\nto retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers. \\n\\n  How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country, \\nour money, and they're spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this: \\nWashington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to \\ncongress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks \\nare making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big \\ncorporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the \\nbanks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but \\nmostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14 \\nhours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time \\nto buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If \\nwe are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if \\nthe point is just to keep the people busy making widgets? \\n\\n  In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, \\\"its chaos!\\\" They \\nsaid, \\\"no, its order.\\\" He defined chaos as that which is he was not \\nable to control.\\n\\n  Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy \\nwould hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no \\nlanguage. (telepathic; and 'vanishing' the closest knowledge of death)\\n(think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and \\npointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably \\nnaive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should \\nbe able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about. \\nThey can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers \\nmight have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a \\ndifferent frequency than us as they aren't eating seeds.\\n\\n  Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a \\nhuge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat \\nonly fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and \\nneed a lot less sleep.\\n\\n  UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over.

(its OK to kill \\neach other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)\\n\\n  Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot \\ntall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they \\nsuck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that \\nthey aren't dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life. \\n\\n  Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women \\nand children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut \\nfrom the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think \\nthat there may be some very interesting results to this, such as \\nmother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples \\nof this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.\\n\\n  That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He \\ntells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which \\nthe people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He'll \\nplay a poker face up until he thinks he's cornered, and then he'll \\nwhine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you're willing to \\nlive on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was \\nright, and he didn't over play his hand, and he won't need to go \\nback and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over \\nyour destiny, just don't live along a path that leads to a reality \\nin which you don't want to be a part of. \",\"How hard or easy would it be to have a combo mission such as a solar sail on\\nthe way out to the outer planets, but once in near to orbit to use more normal\\nmeans..\\nSeems that everyone talks about using one system and one system only per\\nmission, why not have more than one propulsion system?

In fact, JPL is actively\\ninvolved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three\\nimportant ways,\\\" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on\\nthe balloon research campaign.  \\n\\n     \\\"There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,\\\" he\\ncontinued.  \\\"The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,\\nand the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth\\nfor those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own\\nright.\\\"\\n\\n     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more\\npieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the\\nmid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. \\nUnderstanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps\\nscientists construct more accurate computer models which are\\ninstrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.\\n\\n     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL\\ninstruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures\\nozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;\\na submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave\\nradiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier\\ntransform infrared interferometer which monitors how the\\natmosphere absorbs sunlight. \\n\\n     Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-\\nhour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130\\nkilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground\\nstations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.\\nPacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded\\nto separate from the balloon.\\n\\n     \\\"We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared\\nmeasurements,\\\" Margitan explained, \\\"and we also needed to fly in\\ndarkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\\\"\\n\\n     It will be several weeks before scientists will have the\\ncompleted results of their experiments.  They will then forward\\ntheir data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space\\nFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS\\nscientists.    \\n\\n     The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon\\nFacility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a\\ncontract from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was\\nlaunched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction\\nand the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.\\n\\n     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than\\none-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic\\nmeters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with\\nhelium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).

However,\\nusing the info they gather while listening, they can go searching THE right\\nplace and find good, strong evidence, which they can use in court. \\n\\nQuestion : currently, it is easy to wire-tap, from the technical point of\\nview, at least. Anybody using the appropriate radio receiver can listen\\nto communications between a car-telephone and the ground station. The police\\nalso, obviously. The clipper chip will make it much more difficult for the\\nnon-authorized person to eavesdrop (note that I DO NOT write \\u003c\\u003c impossible\\u003e\\u003e ).\\nThe privacy will thus improve from the current situation.

It will bring no more as regards to security. Is it worth ?\\nI think so if its cost is limited, I think that many privacy invasions are done\\nnot only by official services, but also by private entities. The clipper can\\nhelp reducing these.

The Cryptography \\nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \\nevery 21 days.\\n\\n\\nContents:\\n\\n* What is public-key cryptography?\\n* What's RSA?\\n* Is RSA secure?\\n* How fast can people factor numbers?\\n* What about other public-key cryptosystems?\\n\\n\\n* What is public-key cryptography?\\n\\n  In a classic cryptosystem, we have encryption functions E_K and\\n  decryption functions D_K such that D_K(E_K(P)) = P for any plaintext\\n  P. In a public-key cryptosystem, E_K can be easily computed from some\\n  ``public key'' X which in turn is computed from K. X is published, so\\n  that anyone can encrypt messages. If D_K cannot be easily computed\\n  from X, then only the person who generated K can decrypt messages.\\n  That's the essence of public-key cryptography, published by Diffie\\n  and Hellman in 1976.\\n\\n  In a classic cryptosystem, if you want your friends to be able to\\n  send secret messages to you, you have to make sure nobody other than\\n  them sees the key K. In a public-key cryptosystem, you just publish X,\\n  and you don't have to worry about spies.\\n\\n  This is only the beginning of public-key cryptography. There is an\\n  extensive literature on security models for public-key cryptography,\\n  applications of public-key cryptography, other applications of the\\n  mathematical technology behind public-key cryptography, and so on.\\n\\n* What's RSA?\\n\\n  RSA is a public-key cryptosystem defined by Rivest, Shamir, and\\n  Adleman.  For full details, there is a FAQ available by ftp at\\n  RSA.COM. Here's a small example.\\n\\n  Plaintexts are positive integers up to 2^{512}. Keys are quadruples\\n  (p,q,e,d), with p a 256-bit prime number, q a 258-bit prime number,\\n  and d and e large numbers with (de - 1) divisible by (p-1)(q-1). We\\n  define E_K(P) = P^e mod pq, D_K(C) = C^d mod pq.\\n\\n  Now E_K is easily computed from the pair (pq,e)---but, as far as\\n  anyone knows, there is no easy way to compute D_K from the pair\\n  (pq,e). So whoever generates K can publish (pq,e). Anyone can send a\\n  secret message to him; he is the only one who can read the messages.\\n\\n* Is RSA secure?\\n\\n  Nobody knows. An obvious attack on RSA is to factor pq into p and q.\\n  See below for comments on how fast state-of-the-art factorization\\n  algorithms run. Unfortunately nobody has the slightest idea how to\\n  prove that factorization---or any realistic problem at all, for that\\n  matter---is inherently slow. It is easy to formalize what we mean by\\n  ``RSA is\\u002fisn't strong''; but, as Hendrik W. Lenstra, Jr., says,\\n  ``Exact definitions appear to be necessary only when one wishes to\\n  prove that algorithms with certain properties do _not_ exist, and\\n  theoretical computer science is notoriously lacking in such negative\\n  results.''\\n\\n* How fast can people factor numbers?\\n\\n  It depends on the size of the numbers. In October 1992 Arjen Lenstra\\n  and Dan Bernstein factored 2^523 - 1 into primes, using about three\\n  weeks of MasPar time. (The MasPar is a 16384-processor SIMD machine;\\n  each processor can add about 200000 integers per second.) The\\n  algorithm there is called the ``number field sieve''; it is quite a\\n  bit faster for special numbers like 2^523 - 1 than for general numbers\\n  n, but it takes time only about exp(O(log^{1\\u002f3} n log^{2\\u002f3} log n)) in\\n  any case.\\n\\n  An older and more popular method for smaller numbers is the ``multiple\\n  polynomial quadratic sieve'', which takes time exp(O(log^{1\\u002f2} n\\n  log^{1\\u002f2} log n))---faster than the number field sieve for small n,\\n  but slower for large n. The breakeven point is somewhere between 100\\n  and 150 digits, depending on the implementations.\\n\\n  Factorization is a fast-moving field---the state of the art just a few\\n  years ago was nowhere near as good as it is now. If no new methods are\\n  developed, then 2048-bit RSA keys will always be safe from\\n  factorization, but one can't predict the future. (Before the number\\n  field sieve was found, many people conjectured that the quadratic\\n  sieve was asymptotically as fast as any factoring method could be.)\\n\\n* What about other public-key cryptosystems?\",\"\\nYow! Am I ENCRYPTING yet?\\n\\nDidn't we go over this guns'n'crypto discussion a few months ago? Must\\nwe go over it again?\",\" \\u003esupposed to develop cryptosystems. If the government chooses to go\\n \\u003eahead and sell those cryptosystems to the masses, so be it.\",\"\\nAs am I\\n\\nIf \\\"high quality secure NSA classified technology\\\" means handing my key\\nover to whomever, I'll take PGP any day.\\n\\nRight now they are billing it as voluntary, i.e. bend over, here it comes.\\n\\nAs soon as enough Wiretap chip based units are out there, how much\\neasier do you think it will be to redefine \\\"on your own\\\" to mean\\nwrite it yourself and don't even THINK about distributing it...?\\n\\nGet honest, no one is going to buy this trash if they KNOW it's compromised\\nalready, and less will buy it if the algorithm is not disclosed.\\n\\nThe NSA knows that making this stuff available to the public means\\nhanding it to whatever foreign powers are interested in the process.\\nSince when has export control stopped anyone (especially software wise)\\n\\nAsk yourself carefully if \\\" high quality secure NSA classified technology \\\"\\nis something they are going to hand out.  Not unless you can drive a\\nNSA van through the holes.\\n\\nuni (Dark)\\n\",\"\\n   \\u003e :Thousands?  Tens of thousands?  Do some arithmetic, please...  Skipjack\\n   \\u003e :has 2^80 possible keys.\\n   \\u003e \\n   \\u003e We don't yet know if all 80 bits count.\\n\\n   That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something\\n   they can get caught at.  And key size is one of the things that can be\\n   verified externally.  Feed lots of random key\\u002finput pairs into the\\n   chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the\\n   output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output\\n   bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.\\n\\n   If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that\\n   some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that\\n   they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,\\n   DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output\\n   change rate appears as early as round 5.

So the\\n  proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs by less than one part \\n  in three thousand to be cost-effective. \\n\\nBACKGROUND\\n\\nUntil now, phones have happened to allow the existence of \\\"wiretaps\\\",\\ndetectors which could pick up conversations on a phone line.  And over\\ntime, law enforcement agencies have come to rely on this capability to\\naid in criminal investigations.  However, powerful new encryption\\ntechnologies threaten this status quo, by making possible truly\\nprivate communication.  A small chip in each phone could soon make it\\nliterally impossible to overhear a conversation without physical\\nmicrophones at either end.\\n\\nIn order to preserve the ability of law enforcement agencies to tap\\nphone conversations, the U.S. government announced on April 16, 1993\\nthat it had developed and begun manufacturing a special \\\"wiretap\\\" chip\\nto be placed in future phones, instead of the total privacy chips\\nwhich have been under private development.  The same day, AT&T\\nannounced it would use these chips \\\"in all its secure telephone\\nproducts\\\".\\n\\nEach chip would be created under government supervision, when it would\\nbe given a fixed indentifier and encryption key.  Periodically during\\neach conversation, the chip would broadcast its identifier and other\\ninfo in a special \\\"law enforcement block\\\".  Law enforcement officers\\nwith a court order could then obtain the key corresponding to the\\nindentifier from special trust agencies, and could thereby listen in\\non any future or previously recorded conversations on that phone.\\n\\nTo date, most concerns voiced about this plan have been about its\\nsecurity.  The government won't disclose the encryption algorithm, and\\nmany suspect the government will not limit its access in the way it\\nhas claimed.  The track record of previous governments does not\\ninspire confidence on this point [1].\\n\\nHowever, this paper will neglect these concerns, and ask instead\\nwhether this new wiretap chip is a cost-effective tool for police\\ninvestigation.  That is, which is a cheaper way for society to\\ninvestigate crime: force phone communications to support wiretaps, or\\ngive police agencies more money to investigate crimes in other ways?\\nOr to put it another way, would police agencies be willing to pay for\\neach wiretap, if they had to pay their share of the full social cost\\nof forcing phones to support wiretaps?\\n\\nTo start to answer this question, we might compare the current\\nbenefits wiretaps provide to law enforcement agencies with projected\\ncosts of implementing the new wiretap chip plan.  And since current\\nbenefits are easier to estimate, we begin there.\\n\\nWIRETAP BENEFITS\\n\\n1990 is the latest year for which wiretap statistics are available\\n[2].  In that year, 872 wiretap installations were requested, and no\\nrequests were denied.  (This figure does not include wiretaps obtained\\nwith the consent of a party to the conversation.)  2057 arrests\\nresulted from wiretaps started the same year, 1486 arrests came from\\nwiretaps in previous years, and 55% of arrests led to convictions.\\n76% of the wiretaps were for phones (vs pagers, email, etc.), 60% were\\nregarding drug offenses, and 40% were requested by federal\\nauthorities.  Each wiretap installation heard an average of 1487\\ncalls, 22% of them incriminating, among 131 people, and cost an\\naverage of $45,125 (extrapolating from the 794 installations\\nreporting costs), mostly for labor.\\n\\nThus a total of about $40 Million was spent on wiretaps, to obtain\\nabout 4000 arrests, at $10,000 per arrest.  Thus these arrests are at\\nleast four times more expensive than the $2500 per arrest figure one\\ngets by dividing the $28 Billion spent by all police nationally by the\\ntotal 11 Million non-traffic arrests [3].  Thus the $30 Million per\\nyear spent on phone taps is only one thousanth of the total police\\nexpenditures.  And if we divide this by the 138 Million phone \\\"access\\\"\\nlines in the country [3], we get about 23 cents spent per year per\\nphone line, or about two cents a month.\\n\\nIn general, we deter a given class of criminals through a combination\\nof a perceived probability of being caught and convicted, and some\\nexpected punishment level if convicted.  So the social value of having\\nwiretaps is no more than the amount that we would have to pay to get\\nthe same criminal deterrence through other means.  If unable to\\nwiretap a particular suspect's phone, police might instead use hidden\\nmicrophones, or investigate that suspect in other ways.  Or police\\nmight focus on suspects more easily investigated without wiretaps.  Or\\nwe might raise the fine or prison time for certain types of crime.\\n\\nIf we generously assume that these substitutes for wiretaps would be\\non average twice as expensive as wiretaps, then the annual social\\nbenefit of phone wiretaps is about equal to the current spending level\\nof two cents a month per phone line.\\n\\nWIRETAP COSTS\\n\\nLet us for the moment optimistically assume that the US government\\nencryption scheme is as secure as whatever private enterprise would\\nhave offered instead, protecting our conversations from the spying\\nears of neighbors, corporations, and governments, both foreign and\\ndomestic.  Even so, the need to support wiretaps would add many\\nadditional costs to build and maintain our communication system.\\n\\nExtra law enforcement blocks would be added to phone transmissions,\\nincreasing traffic by some unknown percentage.  A special process must\\nbe used to add encryption keys to chips, while securely distributing\\nthese keys to special agencies, which must be funded and monitored.\\nThe chips themselves are designed by a military contractor, whose\\ndesign is to remain secret, and are manufactured through a special\\nprocess so that the chip becomes nearly impossible to take apart.\\n(Chips are now offered at the relatively high price of $30 a peice in\\nlots of 10,000 [4].)  Private encryption systems not supporting\\nwiretaps would require none of these extra costs.\\n\\nPerhaps most important, government degree would at least partially\\nreplace private marketplace evolution of standards for how voice is to\\nbe represented, encrypted, and exchanged in our future phones.  It is\\nwidely believed that governments are less efficient than private\\nenterprise in procuring products and standards, though they may perhaps\\nperform a useful brokering role when we choose between competing private\\nstandards.  How much less efficient is a matter of debate, some say\\nthey pay twice as much, while others might say only 10% more.    \\n\\nCurrently, a total of $96 Billion is spent as operating expenses of\\nU.S. phone companies [3], which comes out to about $60 per month per\\naccess line.  If we compare this to the wiretap value of two cents per\\nmonth, we see that if wiretaps raise average operating costs by even\\nas much as one part in 3000, then wiretaps are not cost effective!\\nAnd this doesn't even include extra costs phone owners pay because\\ntheir encryption chips are more expensive.  Of course most phones\\nwouldn't have encryption chips for a while, but the wiretap benefit\\nper phone is still the same, so this argument still applies.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nGiven this dramatic difference between the total cost of running the\\nphone system and the value of wiretaps, we can justify only the\\nslightest modification of the phone system to accommodate wiretaps.\\nWhen the only modification required was to allow investigators in to\\nattach clips to phone wires, wiretap support may have been reasonable.\\nBut when we consider substantial modification, the burden of proof is\\nclearly on those proposing such modification to show that the costs\\nwould really be less than the benefits.  \\n\\nIf consensus cannot be obtain on this cost\\u002fbenefit estimate, a\\ncompromise might be to tax phones which do not support wiretaps at a\\nrate of say five cents per month, a tax payable to police agencies\\nnationwide to compensate them for their loss of wiretap abilities.\\n\\n[1] The Invisible Weapon, Oxford Press, ISBN 0-19-506273-6\\n\\n[2] Report on Applications for Orders Authorizing or Approving the\\n    Interception of Wire, Oral, or Electronic Communications, 1990,\\n    Administrative Office of U.S. Courts, Washington, DC 20544.\\n\\n[3] U.S. Statistical Abstracts, 1992.  \\n\\n[4] Dorothy Denning, \\\"The Clipper Chip: A Technical Summary\\\",\\n    distributed to sci.crypt newsgroup April 21, 1993. \",\"\\n\\nNice to think, but naive.

It does not go into\\ngreat detail, and is almost certainly not exhaustive.  Obviously, many\\nof the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in\\ngeneral, and will pertain to secure mail programs other than RIPEM.\\nIt is maintained by Marc VanHeyningen \\u003cmvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu\\u003e.  It\\nis posted monthly to a variety of news groups; followups pertaining\\nspecifically to RIPEM should go to alt.security.ripem.\\n\\nCRYPTANALYSIS ATTACKS\\n---------------------\\n\\n- Breaking RSA would allow an attacker to find out your private key,\\n  in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign\\n  messages with your private key.\\n\\n  RSA is generally believed to be resistant to all standard\\n  cryptanalytic techniques.  Even a standard key (about 516 bits with\\n  RIPEM) is long enough to render this impractical, barring a\\n  huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring.\\n\\n- Breaking DES would allow an attacker to read any given message,\\n  since the message itself is encrypted with DES.  It would not allow\\n  an attacker to claim to be you.\\n\\n  DES has only 56 bits in its key, and thus could conceivably be\\n  compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware, but few agencies\\n  have such money to devote to simply read one message.  Since each\\n  message has a different DES key, the work for each message would\\n  remain high.\\n\\nKEY MANAGEMENT ATTACKS\\n----------------------\\n\\n- Stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking\\n  RSA.  To safeguard it, it is encrypted with a DES key which is derived\\n  from a passphrase you type in.  However, if an attacker can get a copy\\n  of your private keyfile and your passphrase (by snooping network\\n  packets, tapping lines, or whatever) he could break the whole scheme.\\n\\n  The main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the\\n  private key file across an untrusted link.  So don't do that.  Run \\n  RIPEM on a trusted machine, preferably one sitting right in front of\\n  you.  Ideally, your own machine in your own home (or maybe office)\\n  which nobody else has physical access to.\\n\\n- Fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could \\n  allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him\\n  rather than to the real recipient.  If the enemy can fool your\\n  intended recipient as well, he could re-encrypt the messages with\\n  the other bogus public key and pass them along.\\n\\n  It is important to get the proper public keys of other people.\\n  The most common mechanism for this is finger; assuming the opponent\\n  has not compromised routers or daemons or such, finger can be \\n  given a fair amount of trust.  The strongest method of key\\n  authentication is to exchange keys in person; however, this is\\n  not always practical.  Having other people \\\"vouch for you\\\" by\\n  signing a statement containing your key is possible, although \\n  RIPEM doesn't have features for doing this as automatically as\\n  PGP.  RIPEM does generate and check MD5 fingerprints of public keys\\n  in the key files; they may be exchanged via a separate channel for\\n  authentication.\\n\\nPLAYBACK ATTACKS\\n----------------\\n\\n- Even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography, an opponent could\\n  still cause difficulties.  For example, suppose you send a message\\n  with MIC-ONLY (a PEM mode which does not provide disclosure protection)\\n  to Alice which says \\\"OK, let's do that.\\\" Your opponent intercepts\\n  it, and now resends it to Bob, who now has a message which is\\n  authenticated as from you telling him to do that.  Of course, he may\\n  interpret it in an entirely different context.  Or your opponent\\n  could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later,\\n  figuring it would be seen differently at a later time.  Or the\\n  opponent could change the Originator-Name: to himself, register \\n  your public key as his, and send a message hoping the recipient\\n  will send him return mail indicating (perhaps even quoting!) the\\n  unknown message.\\n\\n  To defeat playback attacks, the plaintext of each message should \\n  include some indication of the sender and recipient, and a unique\\n  identifier (typically the date).  A good front-end script for RIPEM\\n  should do this automatically (IMHO).  As a recipient, you should be\\n  sure that the Originator-Name: header and the sender indicated within\\n  the plaintext are the same, that you really are a recipient, and that\\n  the message is not an old one.  Some this also can and should be\\n  automated.  The author of this FAQ has made a modest attempt at\\n  automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated\\n  headers; the programs are included in the standard distribution in\\n  the utils directory.\\n\\nLOCAL ATTACKS\\n-------------\\n\\n- Clearly, the security of RIPEM cannot be greater than the security of\\n  the machine where the encryption is performed.  For example, under\\n  UNIX, a super-user could manage to get at your encrypted mail,\\n  although it would take some planning and effort to do something like\\n  replace the RIPEM executable with a Trojan horse or to get a copy of\\n  the plaintext, depending how it's stored.\\n\\n  In addition, the link between you and the machine running RIPEM is\\n  an extension of that.  If you decrypt with RIPEM on a remote machine\\n  which you are connected to via network (or, worse yet, modem), an\\n  eavesdropper could see the plaintext (and probably also your\\n  passphrase.)\\n\\n  RIPEM should only be executed on systems you trust, obviously.  In\\n  the extreme case, RIPEM should only be used on your own machine,\\n  which you have total control over and which nobody else has access\\n  to, which has only carefully examined software known to be free of\\n  viruses, and so on.  However, there's a very real trade-off between\\n  convenience and security here.\\n\\n  A more moderately cautious user might use RIPEM on a UNIX workstation\\n  where other people have access (even root access), but increase\\n  security by keeping private keys and the (statically linked, of\\n  course) executable on a floppy disk.\\n\\n  Some people will keep RIPEM on a multi-user system, but when dialing\\n  in over an insecure line, they will download the message to their\\n  own system and perform the RIPEM decryption there.  However, the\\n  security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory; since\\n  you presumably type your cleartext password to log in, you've just\\n  given away the store, since the attacker can now log in as you and\\n  install traps in your account to steal your private key next time\\n  you use it from a less insecure line.  This will likely remain the\\n  situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of\\n  cleartext password authentication.\\n\\n  I find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully I manage my\\n  security arrangement in my .plan next to my public key, so that\\n  potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are\\n  in place.  Some people use two keys, a short one which is not\\n  carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated\\n  with greater care for critical correspondence.\\n\\nUNTRUSTED PARTNER ATTACKS\\n-------------------------\\n\\n- RIPEM's encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key\\n  corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the\\n  traffic.  However, once someone with that key gets the message, she\\n  may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes.  There \\n  exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient, say, taking an\\n  ENCRYPTED message and converting it to a MIC-ONLY message, signed by\\n  you and readable by anyone, although RIPEM does not provide this\\n  functionality.  Indeed, the latest PEM draft I have seen specifically\\n  states that such transformations should be possible to allow\\n  forwarding functions to work.\",\"I recently saw a message here (posted by Bob Silverman, I think) which \\nreferred to a \\\"birthday\\\" attack on a cryptosystem. I'm looking for \\nreferences on, and explanations of, this type of attack.\",\"Secrecy in Clipper Chip\\n\\nThe serial number of the clipper chip is encrypted with the system key and\\ntransmitted as one part of a three part message.\\n\\nPresumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential\\nanalysis).\\n\\nPostulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip\\nand its communications channel.

The first part of the plan is to begin a \\ncomprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues \\nsuch as export controls which have effectively denied most people \\neasy access to robust encryption as well as law enforcement issues \\nposed by new technology.\\n\\n       However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has \\nalready reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before \\nany public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the \\nAdministration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone \\nequipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed \\nby the National Security Agency. The so-called \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is an \\n80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into \\nchips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow \\nagents would store users' keys, and be required to turn them over \\nlaw enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The \\nencryption scheme used is to be classified, but they chips will be \\navailable to any manufacturer for incorporation into their \\ncommunications products.\\n\\n       This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .\\n\\n       First, the Administration appears to be adopting a solution \\nbefore conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper chip may \\nnot be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may \\nhave better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the \\ngovernment as the sole source for Clipper or any other chips.  Rather,\\nindependent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets \\nbased on open standards.\\n\\n       Second, an algorithm can not be trusted unless it can be tested. \\nYet the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm \\nclassified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public \\nand open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a \\nstandard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.  \\n\\n       Third, while the use of the split-key, dual-escrowed \\nsystem may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and \\nlaw enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored \\npublicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the \\nsafety of their keys?  Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive \\nindividual's fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal \\ninquiries?  \\n\\n       In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the \\nimportance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into \\ndigital privacy and security.  However, the \\\"Clipper chip\\\" solution \\nought to be considered as part of the inquiry, not be adopted before \\nthe discussion even begins.\\n\\nDETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:\\n\\nESCROW\\n\\nThe 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of \\nwhom hold 40 bits of each key.  Upon presentation of a valid \\nwarrant, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts \\nover to law enforcement agents.  Most likely the Attorney General \\nwill be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the \\nAdministration have suggested one non-law enforcement federal \\nagency, perhaps the Federal Reserve, and one non-governmental \\norganization.  But, there is no agreement on the identity of the agents \\nyet.\\n\\nKey registration would be done by the manufacturer of the \\ncommunications device.  A key is tied to the device, not to the person \\nusing it.\\n\\nCLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS\\n\\nThe Administration claims that there are no back door means by \\nwhich the government or others could break the code without \\nsecuring keys from the escrow agents and that the President will \\nbe told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order \\nto prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for \\nan all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security \\narrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results \\nof the investigation would then be made public.\\n\\nGOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER\\n\\nIn order to get a market moving, and to show that the government \\nbelieves in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big \\ncustomers for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, \\nVP Al Gore, and maybe even the President. \\n\\nFROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:\\n\\nJerry Berman, Executive Director\\nDaniel J.

For private\\nownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must\\nbe able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe\\ncondition. If any random private citizen could not properly\\nkeep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation\\nis clearly appropriate.\\n\\n\\n\\nI disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend\\nthemselves and their community. If you look at the American \\nrevolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves\\nfrom, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They\\ndidn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for \\nexample) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same\\nold regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and\\ndestroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate.\\nBut their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suited\\nfor that.\\n\\nThere is also the question of personal and collective arms: The\\nSecond Amendment definately protects ownership of personal\\nweapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members\\nto provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it covers\\nother arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example)\\na tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively)\\nshould. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a \\ndisproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower.\\nThe militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely\\ndemocratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only\\n50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower would\\nbe proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular\\nwill were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the\\nmembers supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the\\nform of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia's\\nfirepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not\\nof the general public.

The sad truth is: sometimes that is\\ngood, or at least, better than the alternative.\\n\\n\\nOk.  There are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [1], and the\\nnumber has been in decline since early this century [2].  Most of these\\naccidents involve rifles or shot guns, not handguns.\\n\\n...\\n\\nIn fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that. \\nThe idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliber\\nhandgun) was designed to kill or hurt people, even for self defense,\\nwould, I'm sure, come as a surprise to its designer.  It certainly isn't\\nwhy I have it.  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it,\\nand might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to\\nkill people.\\n\\n\\nIn fact, that is what happens most of the time.  Most self defensive uses\\nof firearms don't involve firing any shots.  Most criminals would prefer\\nnot to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing what\\nyou say when you point a gun at them.\\n\\nIf you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, to\\nimmediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  A handgun is\\nabout the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work\\nthe best.[3]\\n\\n\\nCertainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing)\\naren't deadly weapons.  However, it simply isn't true to say that all of\\nthem were designed to kill people.  Moreover, what exactly is wrong with\\nhaving deadly weapons?  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to\\nuse deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  I consider it not just my right,\\nbut my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and\\nknowing how to use the tools to do that.\\n\\n\\\"The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear\\narms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in\\ngovernment.\\\"\\n\\t- T. Jefferson.\\n\\nI think what Jefferson said is still true.\\n\\n\\nNot very often compared to other use.[3]\\n\\n\\nThis isn't that common either, at least when compared to other uses.  It is\\nvery rare that a non-violent person will suddenly \\\"get-pissed\\\" and kill\\nsomeone, gun or not.  In most cases, the people who murder have long\\nhistories of violence.  If you have good reason to believe that these\\npeople wouldn't kill if they didn't have a gun, feel free to present it.\\n\\n\\nRight, but there are times when killing things is called for.  I hope I\\nnever have to shoot a person, but I've had to kill a number of animals from\\nrodents to cows, and when I do, I don't want them to suffer any more than\\nis necessary.  I prefer they die instantly, but failing that, I want them\\nto drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that,\\nI don't want them to go fast or far.  I try to choose the best weapon and\\nammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I'm\\nafter, but it doesn't always work as I plan.  Without belaboring the point,\\npeople who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns,\\nparticularly handguns, haven't used them much for that purpose.\\n\\n\\n[1] Accidental deaths in 1988:\\n\\t48700 deaths by auto\\n\\t11300 deaths by fall\\n\\t 5300 deaths by drowning\\n\\t 4800 deaths by fire\\n\\t 4400 deaths by poison\\n\\t 3200 deaths by food\\n\\t 1400 deaths by firearm\\n\\n     Source: Statistics Department, National Safety Council.\\n     \\\"Accidents Facts 1988 Edition\\\".

Have a\\nBystander or witness(Or Create one by yelling at the top of your lungs!)\\ncall the police, and wait! Reholster your weapon VISIBLY! Or place it on \\nthe ground nearby. Do not attempt to recollect your brass.The police will\\nuse it's location to piece together the scene along with your testimony and\\nthat of any witnesses. Mentally mark witnesses! If the police say that none\\ncame forward let them know who you saw! Attempt to keep your weapon loaded\\nwith the minimum required(how the hell can I phrase this?) Try to avoid special\\npurpose ammunition.

Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a\\nfriend.\\n\\nThe NEJM study is based on the immediate dis-\\nposition of cases and fails to take into account cases\\noriginally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be\\nself-defense.  Especially considering the small sample \\nsize (396), taking these events into account has a sub-\\nstantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted.\\n\\nCriminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif-\\nerent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be \\nused, successfully, by a private citizen against an \\naggressor than it is to kill anyone at all.  Further, per-\\nsons defending themselves from aggression by using a \\ngun fare better than those who resist vicimization by\\nsome other means, or who offer no resistance at all.\\nStatistics available from the FBI and other agencies \\nalso show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be\\nused by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat\\nthan to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times\\nmore likely to be used to defend against a criminal\\nthreat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times\\nmore likely to defend against criminal threat than to be\\nused to commit suicide.\\n\\nIt is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can \\nbe proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.  One has\\nto consider carefully what questions were asked by\\nthose gathering the data before one can draw an accu-\\nrate conclusion from them.\\n\\nD.F.

'the people' seems to have been a term of art employed in\\n  select parts of the Constitution.

Unfortunately, no second amendment case has successfully\\ngotten to the court in fifty years. However, that does not change the\\ninterpretation.\\n\\nFurthermore, it appears that others disagree with you as well, vis:\\n\\n \\\"The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept,\\n  and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the\\n  United States, as well as its interpretation by every major\\n  commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratifi-\\n  cation, indicates that what is protected is an individual right\\n  of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner.\\\"\\n   - Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the\\n     Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate,\\n     97th Congress, Second Session ( February 1982 )\\n\\nYou might rightfully ask \\\"well then, what does that first bit about\\nmilitias mean?\\\"\\n\\nWell, \\\"militia\\\" in historical context basically means the whole of the\\nadult males of the country.

Miller (1939).\\n\\nThe reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale\\nbehind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people to\\nbear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of military\\npower could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short, the\\ngovernment would remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather than\\nthe other way around.\\n\\n   \\\"No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.

He left his third-floor bedroom and began\\nlooking around the house, making sure women and children were secure and \\nchecking that everyone had their gas masks on properly. Within hours, the    \\ncompound became an inferno. Nine Branch Davidians excaped.\\n   This is their story, gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them\\nwho are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder. That day the \\nsix said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world    \\nsince Koresh's right-hand man, Steve Schneider, ripped out the compounds's \\nphone line after FBI agents called before dawn Monday saying this was the\\ncults last chance: Come out or prepare to get forced out.\\n    They kept their word. By dawn, tanks were battering the Mount Carmel\\ncompound, punching for hours to creat holes for tear gas to enter. The BD\\nmeanwhile proceeded with their daily routines. Strapped into gas masks, the\\nwomen did laundry. Others read Bibles in their rooms. The 17 children, all\\nunder 10, remained by their mothers' sides. Still, it was hard to ignore what    \\nwas happening around them. Each time a tank rammed the poorly-constructed building\\nit shook violently. Cult members dodges falling gypsum wallboard and doors.\\nHundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were filling\\nthe air with noxious fumes. The flying canisters were more frightening than\\nthe tanks. At least one man was hit in the face. The gas began filling the air,\\ndriven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks\\nmade. Scattered throughout the house, the cult members made no efforts to\\ngather. Then the FBI sent in its biggest weapon -- a massive armored vehicle\\nheaded for a chamber, lined with cinder blocks, where authorities hoped to \\nfind Koresh and Schneider and fire tear gas directly at them.\\n  Here the cult members' story diverges from the government's version. The\\nFBI says cult members set fires in three places. But each of the six cult\\nmembers, in separate discussions with lawyers, consistently gave versions\\nat odds with the FBI's account. They say the tank flattened a barrel of \\npropane, spilling its contents. And as the tank thundered through the house,\\nit tipped over lit lanterns, spitting flames that ignited the propane and\\nother flammables. The home of used lumber, plywood, and wallboard tacked \\ntogether with tar paper was vulnerable. The building erupted. Nine BD's\\nescaped jumping through windows and dashing through other openings.

U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge\\nasks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because\\nof possible influences on the Weaver\\u002fHarris case.\\n\\nThe testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently\\nended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither\\nby KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.\\n\\nThe day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley,\\nwho had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person\\nnamed Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting as\\nan informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms\\nin his dealings with Randy Weaver.\\n\\nFadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an\\nAryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The two\\nthen met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in\\ntime) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weapons\\ntransaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, \\\"He felt like he\\n(Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the\\nWhite cause.\\\"\\n\\nThe two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and\\nlater went to a city park to make the sale.  During this second\\nmeeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to\\ntape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12-\\ngauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of\\n19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge\\nshotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of\\n24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel\\nlength and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaver\\nis reported to have said that he could perform better work once\\nhis machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility\\nof future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars\\nfor the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty\\ndollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have\\nsimply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 -\\nover a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).\\n\\nThe next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated that\\nhis \\\"source\\\" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead\\nof the one-hundred fifty he'd promised.  At this point, Weaver\\nsuspected he was dealing with an informant, \\\"I had a guy in\\nSpokane tell me you were bad.\\\"  Fadeley managed to convince\\nWeaver otherwise.\\n\\nThe _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were\\nmade of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of these\\nmeetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ also\\nreported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki\\nWeaver (Randy Weaver's wife) was played to the court.  There must\\nhave also been phone taps.\\n\\nThese tapes were played to the court via both headphones and\\nloudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver's\\nattorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to\\nmake sure that the government proved its case, \\\"...if it has a\\ncase at all...\\\" according to the rules.\\n\\nRandy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his\\nwife's voice on the tape.\\n\\nU.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear\\naccounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the\\nWeaver\\u002fHarris case.  Exactly how such information could affect\\nthis trial is not explained.\\n\\nOther notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning\\nKevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are\\nsurprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they were\\nsurprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained\\nin the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when Randy\\nWeaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that\\nHarris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a report\\nthat the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming\\nat Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics\\nare charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the\\nonly non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and\\nDeputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that\\nHarris's survival is simply due to divine intervention.\",\"\\nCorrection: The *FBI* *says* that two of the nine who escaped said the fire\\nwas deliberately set by cult members.  Since the press was kept miles away,\\nwe have absolutely no independent verification of any of the government's\\nclaims in this matter.\\n\",\"This was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list.\\n=============================================================\\nHi Folks;\\n\\nThursday, April 15 marked Day 3 of the trial.\\n\\nThis day marked the first testimony of the trial.  Deputy\\nU.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution.\\n\\nThe short version is that his testimony was consistent with\\nthe opening statements for the prosecution.\\n\\nCooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington)\\non August 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation\\nwith five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team was\\nusing night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up\\ninto two teams of three people.  The six later met at an\\nobservation point above the cabin.  After this, deputies\\nCooper, William Degan, and Arthur Roderick began a descent to\\nscout further possible surveillance sites.\\n\\nCooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into\\na gully to see, \\\"whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond.\\\"\\nStriker, the Weaver's yellow lab, started toward them barking\\nloudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area.\\n\\nThey ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the\\n\\\"fern field\\\"] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time, Kevin\\nHarris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillance\\nteam had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they should\\ntake cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy\\ntarget and might be \\\"shot in the back.\\\"\\n\\nAs Degan reached the Y, he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the\\nroad from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire.\\n\\nAt this moment, Striker reached Degan, and Cooper had to \\\"fend\\nhim off with his gun.\\\"  [It is unclear whether this means he\\nclubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan then\\ntook cover in the woods.  According to Cooper, Kevin Harris and\\nSamuel Weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not\\nnoticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road, Degan\\ngot up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, \\\"Stop!  U.S.\\nMarshal!\\\"  Harris then \\\"...brought the weapon around at hip level\\nand fired.  He didn't bring the weapon up to eye level.  I saw\\nBill's arm going back, and I knew he had been hit.\\\"  Cooper fired\\nat Harris, and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weapon\\nto bear on Samuel, but did not fire.  At this point, Cooper then\\nheard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in the\\ndirection of the shots, yelled, \\\"You son of a bitch!\\\" and ran\\ntoward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him\\nfrom directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the\\ncabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward\\nthe cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan, he placed his first two\\nfingers on Degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and\\nthen his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter, Roderick and the\\nother three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a large\\nburst of gunfire from the area around the cabin.\\n\\nOn cross-examination, David Nevin questioned the point of\\nthrowing rocks into the gulley, asking, \\\"You wanted to lure that\\ndog out so you could shoot that dog, didn't you?\\\"  Nevin also\\npointed out that in last September's testimony, Cooper had\\nclaimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him.\\nCooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and\\ndecided that Thursday's account was correct.  Nevin continued the\\ncross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an\\narmed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at\\nhim [no answer was available].\\n\\nFriday, April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper.\\n\\nNotes: There was no coverage of protestors.\\n\\nDrew\\n==============================================================\\n\",\"\\nEvidence given for her prostitute status, besides the admittedly \\nquestionable claim of the man on trial included:\\n\\n1.
